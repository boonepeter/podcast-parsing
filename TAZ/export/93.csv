6,93,TAZ Transcript Episode 93 - Amnesty - Part Thirteen,
7,93,(part of TAZscripts on Tumblr),
8,93,Griffin," Winter has come to Kepler, West Virginia. It is late December, and the reliable crowd of out-of-state tourists has nestled into Kepler’s hotels and resorts, seeking an authentic snowbound holiday retreat. Twinkling lights cover the town’s buildings and streetlights, and a freshly-cut, garishly decorated tree stands in front of city hall. It’s nighttime, and not a creature stirs in Kepler’s festive streets. But, up the road, to the west, a van speeds down state route 66. The vehicle, emblazoned in the ancient logo of the Monongahela Forest Service, is driven by one Rick Dannon, the agency’s chief arborist. With his working day of tending to the forest’s trees behind him, he has packed up his tools and left the forest to head home. But through his windshield, the winding highway begins to vanish before his eyes as a sudden furious snowstorm materializes in front of him. Thick, white flakes whipped into a frenzy by a powerful wind blanket his vision in seconds. Panicked, he bears down on the brake pedal and wrestles with the steering wheel, attempting to maintain control of the vehicle and pull over to the side of the road."
9,93,"And then, as quickly as it appeared, the storm passes. The van’s wipers kick on, revealing the road before him. Rick breathes a sigh of relief, then turns the wheel, pulling back onto the highway to continue his commute. The van pulls away down the winding highway. It passes out of view behind the mountainside. Moments later, a crash echoes through the pines.",
10,93,"[Pause, music swells, then fades]",
11,93,Duck Newton is pulled from his slumber shortly before sunrise by the ringing of a telephone. On the other end is Ranger Juno Divine. She informs him that Rick Dannon died last night [Amnesty theme begins] in a car accident on state route 66. No foul play is suspected. [Amnesty theme continues].,
12,93,Travis, But I guess any time you call Duck Newton there’s some fowl play.
13,93,Griffin," Oh, that’s pretty good."
14,93,Clint, Ha ha haaaa!
15,93,Justin," Is it— is it the— my time, Griffin?"
16,93,[Travis laughing],
17,93,Griffin, Um… 
18,93,[Travis and Griffin laughing],
19,93,Travis, Is Justin finally coming in to his own?
20,93,Griffin," Uh, yeah, Justin, your body’s going through some— you’re going through some wonderful changes."
21,93,Justin," [crosstalk] Is this the change? The change in life. Okay, that was not my— that was not my roll, that was my get the— get the command in there. Um, but I need to do my, uh, I need to have a vision."
22,93,Griffin," Uh, that is true. Why don’t we, uh, why don’t we roll 2 d6 plus Weird, or I guess in your case minus Weird. I love that you keep taking stat upgrades but you’ve never upgraded your Weird because you’re still so spooked out by all this shit."
23,93,Justin," Here’s the thing, the only thing it’s good for is Use Magic and I don’t have magic powers, so what’s the point?"
24,93,Griffin," Sure, sure."
25,93,Justin," [crosstalk] Uh, so I— "
26,93,Travis, [crosstalk] Not— not yet.
27,93,Justin," So in fiction I guess like, [laughs] I woke up, they called me and said “Danimal is dead,” and I said “Aw, shit, I’m going back to sleep. I have to— I have to have a vision about this. [Travis and Griffin laughing] Hold on, let me do a prophecy about it and I will be back with you around 830.”"
28,93,Travis," “You guys, I had the strangest dream that I got a phone call that Danimal is dead!”"
29,93,Griffin," Uh, go ahead and give me a 2 d6 roll."
30,93,Justin, [laughs] Fuck.
31,93,Griffin, [simultaneously] Oh my god [laughing] Justin! Oh my god! Starting arc 3 off with a fuckin’ bang.
32,93,Clint," It’s a 2, ladies and gentlemen."
33,93,Justin, It’s a 2 minus 1.
34,93,Griffin, [incredulously] It’s a 1!
35,93,Justin," It’s the worst possible vision that I could have. I mean, here’s what I’m gonna say, canonically, Griffin. I feel like with a roll of this calibre Duck will have something bad to him— I feel like he’s also pissed himself. [Travis laughs]. Like, I think if he has a vision that is this bad, he has to have wet the bed during it."
36,93,Griffin, Oh my god.
37,93,Justin, Canonical.
38,93,"[crosstalk, indistinguishable]",
39,93,Travis," Like, maybe in the vision he has a vision about using the bathroom."
40,93,Justin, Yeah. 
41,93,Griffin, Yeah.
42,93,Travis, And in real life he just lets go.
43,93,Griffin," Okay. No. This is gonna be a bad vision. And it also means I get to take a hard move on you in the future. Um, which last time was quite bad, so, yeah. I don’t know exactly when I’m gonna cash in that shit. But here is your… here is your vision. "
44,93,"I think that, I think this is the dream you were having when you were awakened by the phone call from Ranger Juno Divine, and it came to you like sort of all of your visions come to you, there’s— there’s something about it, there’s something about this thing that you can see in your dream that makes it different from, sort of, the other dreams that you— that you have. There’s something very— there’s something very vivid about it, but there’s also something kind of, um, artistic, for lack of a better term, about it. Uh, there is something almost like you’re looking at a painting or something like that, um, and the vision that you see is just stars [music[a] begins playing]. ",
45,93,"Not necessarily like you are, you know, lying on the ground and looking up and looking at the stars, but it’s just stars and there’s— there’s no moon above, you’re just looking up into the stars almost like you’re in them. And you see this for like, a long time, I think this is a long vision. For— for several minutes you just see these stars and then one of them appears to be getting larger, and it’s kind of at the center of your view and it’s getting larger and larger still, and then you realize that it’s not a star at all. What is approaching you is… a meteor [music changes]. And it is coming at you faster and faster and as it collides with whatever your point of view is, you wake up to the sound of a telephone ringing. [Pause, music quickly fades out]. ",
46,93,"That’s about as bad as these visions get, I think.",
47,93,Justin," Yeah, that’s like, not great."
48,93,Griffin," So, it is December. We are about to start our third arc, our new hunt, our new monster, and just to like, to set the scene and get some of that good character juice… I’m curious what the holidays are like for each of you. Obviously, Aubrey, this is your first sort of holiday season in Kepler and you’re living in Amnesty Lodge and you’ve been there for now four months or so, so I think you’re pretty well settled in there. But Ned and Duck, you’ve lived in Kepler for some time, and I’m just curious what the holiday season is like for each of you."
49,93,Clint," It’s kind of weird for Ned. Growing up, he was always very much “big holiday guy”, loved, you know, family get-togethers and, you know, all of the cousins and uncles and aunts and grandparents getting together and enjoying a meal. But, you know, with the way his life has developed— you know, kind of a life on the shady side— he’s kinda had to give that up. So, holidays are not a big time for Ned. He wishes they were! But, you know, he’s [sic] usually [dejected and depressed] ends up watching the Macy’s parade and eating a cup of gruel—"
50,93,Griffin, [snorting laughter] Jesus Christ. 
51,93,Justin," “Cup of gruel”, where does he even find gruel? [crosstalk] By himself, does he make it by himself—"
52,93,Travis," [crosstalk] It’s an old, sad recipe— "
53,93,Clint, Hot Pockets Gruel. I don’t know if you’ve seen those or not—
54,93,Travis, Ew.
55,93,Clint," — They’re really nasty. But he just sits there in the dark with the TV on watching Macy’s, and y’know— hating on that Al Roker guy and— "
56,93,Griffin," Yeah, good. Um— "
57,93,Clint, It’s just not a lot of  fun—
58,93,Travis," Yeah, dig that beef deeper, dad, go for it."
59,93,Griffin," Yeah, what about the Cryptonomica? Is it— Do you do anything special for your local business in the holidays?"
60,93,Clint," Well, you know, a feeble attempt to decorate. Try to have, like, some special events."
61,93,Justin," God, it’s even sadder. It’s, like, sadder to put on a few strands of lights."
62,93,Clint," Yeah, it does make it even sadder, and y’know nobody comes. Ned’s trying. So most of Ned— he’s decided he’s going to have a Christmas special on “Saturday Night Dead”, and so he’s concentrating his energies there so he doesn’t see how sad his family-less life is on the holidays. So, he’s going to have a special couple of movies on the “Saturday Night Dead”, and, um, just kinda throwing himself into his work—"
63,93,Travis," Like what movies, dad?"
64,93,Griffin," Well, there’s that — what’s the one that MST3K did about like the killers— "
65,93,Justin, Santa Claus vs. the Martians? 
66,93,Clint," Yeah, Santa Claus vs. the Martians would be a good choice."
67,93,Travis," Maybe Jack Frost, but the scary one?"
68,93,Griffin," The Michael Keaton one I don’t remember being especially scary. I mean, I guess he dies and that is inherently kinda scary but he does come back and learn a very valuable lesson about family and that— "
69,93,Travis," He’s a ghost that haunts a snowman, Griffin, what’s not scary about that?"
70,93,Griffin," Yeah, I know it’s spooktacular. Duck, what about you?"
71,93,Justin," So Duck’s sister, Jane, is not in town. He would usually spend the holidays with her but she’s doing mission work in Honduras, so she is not here currently. So he kinda hung out with friends. He didn’t feel too sad about it, it was never a real big thing for his family. A lot of friends were in from outta town. He spent a lot of time doing bar trivia and karaoke and just kinda hanging out with pals that had come back in to Kepler. People he kind of lost touch with. [stutters] So he didn’t feel too bad for himself, like I said, it’s not normally a big deal, but with Jane not there there wasn’t really a chance to do family stuff. He just kind of palled around with folks. But it was nice, it was good to see some of those folks that he hadn’t seen for so long."
72,93,Griffin," Alright. And Aubrey, what about you?"
73,93,Travis," Well, Aubrey doesn’t really do Christmas [Griffin Sure.] Aubrey celebrates Yule, or the Winter Solstice. It started when she was kind of a teenager, and it was a rebellion against her parents and, like, leaning into the magic persona. So I would not say that Aubrey identifies as Wiccan, but with time as she grew older she actually did the research into it and found that it seemed to be a purer form of the things that we associate now with Christmas, and so it became more traditional in her mind and a lot more about the spirit of it without all the stuff piled on to it [Griffin Okay.] That kind of thing and a lot less about, y’know, family. And I think a lot of that now is because she does tend to be on her own a lot more [Griffin Man, yeah.] so she doesn’t really have a lot of traditions that kinda date back to family times."
74,93,Clint," Wow, we are a damaged bunch, aren’t we?"
75,93,Griffin," Yeah, no kidding."
76,93,Travis," Yeah, dude."
77,93,Griffin," That’s good stuff though. I think that’s kind of the aesthetic of Amnesty Lodge, just a lot of festive, warm, welcoming sort-of winter time decorations. And in fact, let’s jump to that. So it’s a few days before Christmas, I want to say it’s the 21st or so, and in the afternoon Mama has called you all in to Amnesty Lodge to discuss your next hunt. Duck and Ned, as you arrive, and Aubrey, as you go to greet them, you all enter a very festive scene in the lobby. It’s decorated with garlands and wreaths, and the hearth is roaring in the centre of the room, providing much-needed warmth to combat the very cold weather outside. Jake and Dani are hanging up some more decorations here in the lobby area, and Moira is tinkling away at the piano trying to figure out some holiday standards sorta by ear. They probably don’t have tho— I mean, they definitely don’t have those in Sylvain, so she’s trying to sort of master them on her own. And Mama emerges from her office, and she’s walking with a cane made of this dark gnarled wood, it wouldn’t surprise you if she made this cane herself from some stuff she gathered in the woods around the lodge. She gives you all a faint smile as she sees you all, and she says"
78,93,Mama," Well, looks we uh— looks like we got the band back together, how y’all been?"
79,93,Duck," Good, you know, my sister Jane was doing missionary work in Honduras, and normally I would spend the holidays with her [Griffin laughing] but I had some friends come in from out of town—"
80,93,Mama," Oh, that sounds nice."
81,93,Duck," — And I wanted to communicate this to anybody who might be listening, somehow, and I thought this might be a more organic way of doing it."
82,93,Mama," Yeah, sure. That’s a strange way of just sort of conversing with another human being. [Justin laughing]"
83,93,Ned," I’m doing well, they have a two-for-one BOGO sale down at the A&P on Gruel Hot Pockets. So— [Justin laughs]"
84,93,Mama, Alright.
85,93,Ned," — Happy holidays, everybody!"
86,93,Travis," Aubrey looks up from her book, and says,"
87,93,Aubrey, I celebrate in like a “not really traditional so much as it’s my tradition!” [sic]
88,93,Travis, And back to the book.
89,93,Mama," Alright. I feel like I knew all that about all y’all already, somehow. I don’t know if maybe it’s because we knew each other for a while, and I’m just on some sort of psychic link level with y’all, but thanks for coming. We, uh— well, we gotta talk, and I’m thinking we might wanna have a change of venue, thanks to the proximity of our special guest."
90,93,Griffin, And she sort of gestures towards the dining area where you all see Agent Stern— 
91,93,Travis, We haven’t killed him yet?
92,93,Griffin, [laughing] No? 
93,93,Travis," Man, we are slipping!"
94,93,Griffin," He’s drinking— yeah, it’s a different age from the Balance age where you all— maybe it’s just because you can’t find a good cliff side to huck a body off of discreetly. But he’s drinking some cider, and he’s going over a Lamplighter with like a red sharpie, circling what you assume to be leads for his own monster hunt."
95,93,Travis," Oh, not just like corrections?"
96,93,Griffin," Uh, he’s probably doing a little bit of that, also. It’s sort of a one man operation with Kirby leading up the publication, so, you know, there’s probably not much copy editing going on there. But she leads you all down into the cellar, which looks completely transformed from the first time that you saw it, thanks to sort of your own modifications and Barclay’s general cleanliness. And you catch him down here as you enter, he’s sliding a tray of food under the net that is sort of covering the kitchen area, where you see Thacker, who still looks unkempt and, like, vaguely inhuman. But he appears to be a lot more docile than he was just a— last time month. He doesn’t seem to respond as the tray slides to his feet, he just kinda sits perfectly still in the center of the kitchen, just kinda clutching his knees and looking down. And after you all settle here in the secret HQ of the Pine Guard, Mama says,"
97,93,Mama," Alright, so, couple updates. First of all, Thacker hasn’t really gotten any more lucid since I brought him back, so no real developments in the, “find what’s bringing monsters to Kepler and stop it” department. I don’t really know if he knows anything that he didn’t write down in his journals, but, until he snaps out of it, we’re just gonna have to remain in the dark on that subject. Have y’all managed to get any leads on seeing where all this stuff’s coming from?"
98,93,Duck," I should’ve put some time into it, honestly, but I uh… I was real busy with family over the holidays, so I didn’t make much—"
99,93,Mama, You literally just said you didn’t have any family in town [crosstalk] over the holidays.
100,93,Duck, [crosstalk] God dammit. [crosstalk] Dammit!
101,93,Mama," [crosstalk] I mean, it’s fine if you couldn’t dig anything up, but you don’t gotta lie to old Mama, you know?"
102,93,Duck," Dammit! [group laughter] Dammit, Duck! [Travis laughing]"
103,93,Mama," You don’t have to beat yourself up about it, Duck, I mean po—"
104,93,Duck, [distant] Fuck!
105,93,Mama," — No, pobody’s nerfect, you gotta calm down, alright?"
106,93,Duck, God dammit. [Travis laughing]
107,93,Mama," Alright, Duck’s having an episode. "
108,93,Duck," I tried to lie, and it just don’t— I just don’t flow! I don’t know how y’all do it!"
109,93,Ned," Oh, it’s easy! [crosstalk] Piece of cake— "
110,93,Duck," [crosstalk] I mean Ned, [laughing] I was trying to be kind."
111,93,Mama," Alright, well it’ll probably be a lot easier to investigate that stuff when we have a monster on our hands. And that kinda brings us to our next subject it’s three days to the full moon, so we’re in the window now, and I keep my ear to the ground when we’re in the window, you know, looking out for police chatter, freaky shit coming into Saint Francis, social media— I’m all plugged into all my sites—"
112,93,Aubrey, What’s your follow count? Are you verified?
113,93,Mama," I am not, and I got about 31. Is that good or bad?"
114,93,Aubrey," How many do you follow? That’s really, you have to do kinda— it’s a ratio?"
115,93,Mama," Yeah, I follow about 300 or so."
116,93,Aubrey, Eughhh.
117,93,Mama," Aw, yeah, I know, I ain’t gone viral yet. But I ain’t seen nothing on— [crosstalk]"
118,93,Aubrey," [crosstalk] Well, I— you were really popular on Vine before that shut down, I’m sorry about that Mama. [crosstalk] We’re all still reeling."
119,93,Mama," [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s shame. Yeah, they did a lot for the Vine. I haven’t seen or heard nothing especially abominable yet, so, y’all got any ideas on— y’all heard anything that might be kind of out of the ordinary?"
120,93,Duck," Is it safe to assume that like— well, you know what? It’s probably nothing, I don’t know, it didn’t seem particularly spooky to me when I heard about it, but um… a friend of mine— sort of friend, Rick Dannon, he died last night, and there wasn’t any foul play or anything suspected, which is not that big of a surprise, I know in this region. The thing that kinda tripped me out about it was that Rick— Rick and I used to work together, Rick Dannon, we called him the Danimal. We used to work together, and he’s the one, when I was first coming up, he’s the one who taught me, like, how to handle the vehicles, how to safe in the snow, and always put your chains on and everything— it just… I don’t know. If somebody was gonna have that kind of accident, wasn’t brought on by some drunk driving idiot or something like that, it seems… I don’t know. It’s probably nothing, I’m just kinda talking out my ass, but it’s the only sort of thing that has stood out to me recently as like, I don’t know, a little weird."
121,93,Griffin," Mama shrugs, and she says,"
122,93,Mama," [sighs] I mean, right now I think it’s probably the best lead we got so far, if we got a death that you think is even a little bit suspicious. I think we should probably check it out— "
123,93,Duck," You know, Mama, honestly, even if isn’t… ghosts and ghouls or whatever, I would like to know what happened. Rick and I had a rough patch there at the end, and uh, I don’t know, I’d just like to know how it all shook out."
124,93,Mama," I am sorry about your friend, Duck. And I think that’s a good idea. I think that’s probably our best lead we got right now. So, how ‘bout this I’ll keep poundin’ the pavement, and keep my ear to the ground, and keep my eye on… uh, you know— "
125,93,Duck," That’s three metaphors, you got anymore, or?"
126,93,Mama," I’ll keep, sort of, my head to the grin— my nose to the grindstone— "
127,93,Ned, Ow!
128,93,Aubrey, Maybe head on a swivel?
129,93,Mama," I’ll keep my head on a swivel and, you know, keep my ear open for anything else I can hear that might sound kinda freaky, but why don’t the three of y’all go check out the— "
130,93,Aubrey, Mama?
131,93,Mama, Yeah?
132,93,Aubrey, Can I go to Sylvain? 
133,93,Mama," Yeah, I mean, if you want to—"
134,93,Aubrey," I just, I— in that last thing, I accessed some new stuff, and I’ve been reading these books trying to make sense of it, and I feel like I’m just reading the same sentence over and over again, and there’s the Minister of Magic over there and I have so many questions."
135,93,Mama," Yeah, I mean, I think it’ll be a good idea. I mean, you won’t be able to go through the gate until tonight, but I think if you wanna head over to Sylvain, you should. You’re free to come and go as you want now."
136,93,Aubrey," I don’t need, like, a permission slip or anything?"
137,93,Mama," [laughing] No, you just need to get the moonlight on the gate and head on over."
138,93,Aubrey, Okay.
139,93,Mama," But for now, why don’t the three of y’all and Barclay go check out the scene of the crash and see what you can find out, see what looks particularly monstrous. "
140,93,Travis," Is it snowing, Griffin, in Kepler?"
141,93,Griffin," Uh, I don’t think it’s snowing right now but it’s going to be pretty cold outside for a while, and so, all of the snow that has fallen is still kinda on the ground. "
142,93,Travis," Oh, so there’s snow, that’s what I mean."
143,93,Griffin," There is snow, yeah. I think public works does its best to keep it off of the roads and the highways, but I think this is probably an area where snow tires are kind of a necessity. [crosstalk] But yeah, there is snow."
144,93,Ned," [crosstalk] Ah ha! I got new chains on the Lincoln, my friends. "
145,93,Aubrey," Okay, Jacob Marley. Uh, Mama, I have a quick question— or a suggestion, maybe, idea? Barclay’s great, but maybe we should take someone who also knows about like snow, and, you know, kinda winter terrain and… maybe see if Jake’s free?"
146,93,Mama," I mean, we don’t usually take Jake along on Pine Guard business, but if you think we need a snow expert, I guess so. I wouldn’t send him into the mouth of a dangerous situation. I wouldn’t send him into the lion’s maw, but if y’all are just goin’ to check out, you know, the scene of a crash, I guess you could take ol’ Jake. You okay with that, Barclay?"
147,93,Griffin," And Barclay, like, nods."
148,93,Aubrey," He’s just been a little bit down. We had a run-in with some neighborhood toughs and they kinda gave him a hard time, and I think it really got to him."
149,93,Mama," Uh, yeah!"
150,93,Aubrey," I just want him to feel a little bit more part of our group, you know?"
151,93,Mama," Yeah, for sure, I think that’s a sweet gesture. Why don’t y’all take Jake Cool-Ice down to the scene of the crash— I think it’ll cheer him up, seeing, you know, a place where a man recently died. [Justin and Travis laugh] I like your instincts there, Aubrey, I think that’ll be real good for him."
152,93,Aubrey, Cool.
153,93,Mama," It’d just sorta confront, sorta, the terminus of the mortal coil that we’re all standin’ on, he’ll realize— [crosstalk]"
154,93,Ned," [crosstalk] I mean, look at the way he leads his life, I mean, he’s reckless and he doesn’t care. He needs to have an appreciation of death."
155,93,Justin, [laughing] Shake him up. [Travis laughs] “I’m Jake Cool-Ice and I’m now an insurance salesman.” [Clint laughs]
156,93,Travis," “You know, death could come at any time.”"
157,93,Justin," “I had to confront that, thanks to a dear friend that was trying to cheer me up once.” [Griffin and Travis laugh]"
158,93,Griffin," Alright, so the three of you head back upstairs in Amnesty Lodge. I want this scene, I think Jake Cool-Ice is like, walkin’ to the door. He’s just finished helping Dani decorate, and he’s got his board and, sort of, his gear on and his goggles, his board’s freshly waxed, and he sort of waves and he’s like,"
159,93,Jake," Oh, hey guys, what’s goin’ on? Y’all look like you’re in a hurry."
160,93,Aubrey," Well, Jake, um, we have got a very important mission we’re gonna go investigate, and I don’t think we can do it without a snow expert. "
161,93,Jake," I mean, I know a lot about snow, but—"
162,93,Griffin," And he leans in close, because Agent Stern’s still kinda in the adjoining room, and he says,"
163,93,Jake," Is this, uh, is this Pine Guard business?"
164,93,Aubrey," Yes it is, Jake. Yes it is."
165,93,Duck," You’re getting the call, man."
166,93,Griffin," He looks fucking psyched, he’s like,"
167,93,Jake," Oh man, I fucking— yes! I knew it, I’ve told Mama for such a long time, like, I’ve got what it takes to save the day. What’re we doing, is there like a mummy or something we need to— "
168,93,Aubrey," Slow down, rook. You’re just getting started, and this is the beginning, but we’ll see, you know. You just keep your head on a swivel, your nose to the grindstone, you keep your ear to the ground."
169,93,Duck, Keep reaching for the stars.
170,93,Aubrey, You reach for the stars [Clint laughing] and we’ll see how it all plays out.
171,93,Griffin," He says,"
172,93,Jake," Alright, let’s go!"
173,93,Griffin," And he sets his board down, and the four of you now head outside towards Ned’s Lincoln. Uh, and as you step outside, it is— it’s the weirdest thing, because you just sort of walked in the front door as you came back up from the cellar, and this wasn’t there before, but now it is there. There is, sitting in front of the door, a small card. And as you sort of approach it, you sort of survey the card— it is written on sort of a fancy white stationary, with a lacy red trim pattern around its border. And at the bottom right corner of the card is a stamp in red ink, and that stamp has a design of a paw print inside of a thick red circle. And written on the card are three bullet point items that— "
174,93,Travis, Oh!
175,93,Griffin," Yes, if you remember, that’s sort of how we’re doing the economy in this game."
176,93,Travis, It was just such a threatening and scary way for it to pop up. [Travis and Clint laughing]
177,93,Griffin," Oh, was it?"
178,93,Travis, Yes! I thought you were about to introduce a serial killer character to the show.
179,93,Clint, The Red Paw!
180,93,Griffin," Uh, written on the card are Heathcliff’s bounties, which are “A lawkeeper’s symbol, [crosstalk] a seer’s spectacles—”"
181,93,Justin, [crosstalk] Badge. First one’s a badge.
182,93,Griffin, “A seer’s [crosstalk] spectacle—”
183,93,Travis and Justin, Glasses!
184,93,Griffin, “And a victorious seed.”
185,93,Travis, Some semen.
186,93,Justin, [laughing] From a really good sports guy.
187,93,[group laughter],
188,93,Griffin," Get huntin’, gumshoes. "
189,93,Justin, “Go get Michael Jordan’s semen!”
190,93,Griffin, Michael’s secret stuff!
191,93,Justin, Get Michael’s secret stuff!
192,93,Travis," “Hey guys, it’s me, Michael Jordan, I just moved to town!”"
193,93,[music fades in],
194,93,Justin," Dad met Joe Namath at San Diego Comic Con, so we got an in there. If we want his champion seed. [Travis laughing]"
195,93,[music],
196,93,Ad Break {27,35 - 3317}
197,93,[Amnesty Theme plays],
198,93,Griffin," So it is around sunset, and the four of you arrive at the scene of the crash on State Route 66, which is just sort of around this sharp hairpin turn around a hillside. And about halfway through the turn, the guardrail has just been demolished, and next to it you see a forest service van that has been hauled out of the woods sort of beyond the guardrail. The front of the car is just crumpled, there’s bits of woodland debris that are sort of stuck to its grill, and sort of in its shattered windshield. There’s no body, that has long since sort of been carted away. Instead there’s just sort of the remainder of this crash. And parked just in front of the van is a Kepler Sheriff’s Department vehicle with its lights flashing. And as you all sort of arrive without any troubles, because of Ned’s expert driving, and good snow tires— I couldn’t think of a great adjective there—"
199,93,Clint, Chains. Great chains. 
200,93,Griffin, You all exit the Lincoln and—
201,93,Clint," Before we do, [Griffin Yeah.] I want to prepare Jake just—"
202,93,Griffin," [crosstalk] Okay. Yeah, let’s have that. "
203,93,Ned," Jake, have you— have you had driver’s ed classes at your school? "
204,93,Jake," I didn’t really go to school, and we don’t really have ca—"
205,93,Travis, [crosstalk] “I’m 43!”
206,93,Jake," Yeah, like— we don’t have cars in Sylvain, so— you recognise what a wild—"
207,93,Ned, They show these— they show these films—
208,93,Jake, Yeah. 
209,93,Ned," In driver’s ed class that I thought— [Jake Okay.] That might prepare you for what you’re about to experience, but nevermind. Neeeevermind. It’ll be fine. "
210,93,Jake," Mmkay. Is there gonna be a monster when we get there, though, or what’s up? "
211,93,Aubrey, You never know!
212,93,Ned," That’s why you gotta keep your head on a swivel, kid!"
213,93,Griffin," He looks— now you’ve made him worried and he continues to look worried as you arrive and get out of the vehicle. And as you do, the driver of this Sheriff’s department car steps out. Duck, you— and Ned, maybe, depending on— you’ve probably had run-ins, I think we’ve established you’ve had— not necessarily criminal run-ins, but sort of distrust from the Sheriff’s department. You all recognise him as Deputy Dewey, Zeke’s second-in-command. He’s just this, like, tall, awkward, kind of young guy, and he’s not especially well dressed for the cold, I think he’s just like wearing a short-sleeved shirt and he does not look especially comfortable out here. And he approaches you as you all step out of the car, and he says, "
214,93,Deputy Dewey," [nasally drawl] Folks, I’m gonna need y’all to keep moving down— [Travis bursts out laughing] Oh. Aw, shit. Duck, what’s happening, man? "
215,93,Duck," Hi, Dewey. "
216,93,Travis," [imitating Dewey’s voice] “Aw shit, why do I sound like this?” "
217,93,Duck," Hey, Dewey, what’s going on, man? "
218,93,Dewey," Aw, you know, just sort of camping out in front of the scene of the— aw, damn! Aw, that’s right, you knew Rick, didn’t you? Aw, sorry— aw man, that’s a bad beat, I’m sorry dude. "
219,93,Duck," Yeah, it’s all right, Dewey. Are you still doing the— that thing where you pretend, with all your friends, to do like dungeon hunts and stuff like that? You throw tennis balls at each other? "
220,93,Dewey," Aw, LARPing? "
221,93,Duck," Yeah, yeah, LARPing! That’s it, shit. "
222,93,Dewey," Yeah, we do a little, you know, creative anachronism here from time to time. We head down into the park and we do— I do a woodland elf, his name’s Zeph— Zephius. And he— he’s a warlock, so I do a little bit of that on the side. You want to come do that with us sometime? "
223,93,Duck," Yeah, first, though, I love the sound of this woodland elf character. Can you tell me 70 hours of stories about him and his friends and all their kind of adventures? "
224,93,Dewey," Um, I mean, maybe, if you wanna, like—"
225,93,Duck," I’ve got time, it’s fine."
226,93,Dewey, Well all right. Well—
227,93,Griffin, [laughing] Are you trying to fucking make it so that Balance is a creation of Deputy Dewey’s mindscape? 
228,93,[Clint and Travis laughing],
229,93,Justin," No, I just want to try to please everybody. You know, some people prefer that, so I figure here, you could have a—"
230,93,Griffin, There is a shocking amount of our listener base that wants there to be ties between all of the different universes we make—
231,93,Justin," Yeah, there are. "
232,93,Griffin," I think— I think if this is the tie between— if Amnesty is just— if Balance is just the fever dream of Amnesty’s new side character Deputy Dewey, that would maybe not be the most satisfying result. "
233,93,Justin, There are connective ties that— it is one coherent planar-verse—
234,93,Griffin," Okay, no. Um—"
235,93,Justin, It is!
236,93,Griffin, Dew— all right. 
237,93,Clint," The planar-verse! I like planar-verse, though. "
238,93,Griffin," Dewey— Dewey says, "
239,93,Dewey," Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that some other time, when I’m off the clock, but I kind of do need y’all to— I mean, this is, like, I don’t know if it’s a crime scene or what, but we gotta investigate, and look into it and wait for the tow truck to come and take the car away, take it to impound so we can take a look at it there. But, yeah, so— it’s nice to see all of y’all. I’m going to head back to my car, because I’m freezing my— my nards off, so. Yeah, do y’all need anything, though? Is there any trouble? "
240,93,Aubrey, ...Coffee? 
241,93,Dewey, Are you saying you… want coffee? Cause I’m not a— I’m not equipped to give you coffee. 
242,93,Aubrey," Okay. I mean, you asked! "
243,93,Justin, Do— I’m going to— I’m trying to think if there’s anything useful—
244,93,Duck," Hey, Dewey— "
245,93,Justin, Let me just— I’ll just straight up ask you for a ser— 'fore I start spinnin' {{3856}} dice. 
246,93,Duck," Dewey, did anything seem, I don’t know, off about this? You've seen some crash sites and stuff like that in your days. Does anything seem weird? "
247,93,Griffin, I’m trying to decide if— I think that you—
248,93,Justin, I could pr—
249,93,Griffin," I think that sort of by your conversation, I think Dewey kind of knows you, and he knows that like this is your buddy who died, and so—"
250,93,Justin," I— let me say this, though, I do think that you could make a rational argument— and I don’t know why I’m trying to make it harder on myself— you could make an argument that— I think you could make the choice that, if maybe you don’t have a lot of authority, you’re a cop in a small town, maybe you don’t have a lot of power, you might tend to get kind of territorial about other [Griffin Sure.] branches of, you know, officials, or however you want to put it. "
251,93,Griffin," I think if this was Sheriff Zeke, I think that would be true. I think Deputy Dewey, I don’t think you need to convince him just to talk to him. I think if you want to actually investigate the car and investigate where the car crashed and see what visual clues you can find, you’ll definitely have to. But I think this is just a roll and Investigate a Mystery, talking to Dewey to ask him questions about what he knows, I think he’ll just tell you. "
252,93,Justin," Okay. I will say, though, a lot of my Investigate a Mystery questions are specific to the creature, which he’s not going to [Griffin Yep.] have any sort of insight into, yeah? "
253,93,Clint," Well there is a “What happened here?”, maybe he can interpret the accident? "
254,93,Justin, Ehh…
255,93,Griffin," Yeah, I mean, he will— I’ll tell you this, Dewey may not know much, but he may know one or two things, and if you ask the right questions, you’ll get that information—"
256,93,Justin," [crosstalk] Ok, yeah, let’s do it."
257,93,Griffin," —if you ask the wrong questions, he won’t. "
258,93,Justin, I’m gonna grill him. Six… plus two. Eight. 
259,93,Griffin," Okay. That’s a mixed success. On a seven to nine, you hold one, so you get to ask one question. What happened here, what sort of creature is it, what can it do, what can hurt it, where did it go, what was it going to do, what is being concealed here? "
260,93,Justin, Mmmm… 
261,93,Griffin," This doesn’t have to be the only Investigate a Mystery thing that you guys do here. In fact, I sort of envision you doing a few, so— yeah, don’t—"
262,93,Justin," Let me ask the broadest possible, and— "
263,93,Duck," It seems obvious, but you’ve seen a lot of crash sites and stuff like that. What do you think really happened here? "
264,93,Dewey," I’ll tell you, just ‘cause, you know, it’s your friend. It might be hard to hear, you sure you want to know about this, Duck? "
265,93,Duck, Yeah. 
266,93,Dewey," All right. I mean, we can— I took a look at sort of the tracks in the ground, and obviously we need to get a detective out here or something, at least the Sheriff to come out and give me his opinion, but my opinion, what happened— he drove through the guard rail and went down the hill a bit and went into the trees, and hit the trees at considerable speed. And that— he probably died on impact, so I guess that’s at least the, you know, the one benefit to this, is it didn’t hurt much, I guess. "
267,93,Duck," Well— ok, but wait. What was the weather like when this happened? "
268,93,Dewey," It was— it was, you know, there was snow on the ground. The road was relatively clear, there was a little bit of dusting on the ground, but seemed to be no issues with— I mean, it wasn’t snowing in Kepler when it happened, so I don’t think weather had anything to do with it. "
269,93,Duck, It just doesn’t make sense. 
270,93,Dewey," It’s the weirdest thing, though, Duck, is, there weren’t any skid marks on the ground. There weren’t any skid marks on the ground, there wasn’t a second set of, you know, of tire tracks, so it’s not like they had to dodge out of the way of something. Wasn’t like they slammed on the brakes to get out of the way of like a deer that was in the road, they just kind of like— they just went. They just went through the guard rail, and that was it. They went through the guard rail real fast, and that was it. So— it’s hard for me to discern a cause, and… yeah, I don’t know. "
271,93,Duck," The brake fluid intact, and everything? "
272,93,Dewey," I mean, the car got pretty fucked up—"
273,93,Duck," Sure, yeah. "
274,93,Dewey," But, uh, I’ve— it’s hard to tell about the brake fluid. "
275,93,Travis," Griffin, could I try— so I want to do Read a Bad Situation, not because I want to read a bad situation, but because I want to use my Third Eye. Does that make sense? Cause it’s like tied together—"
276,93,Griffin," Sure, yeah. I think you could still ask like a question here, off the list, and—"
277,93,Travis, Ugh. Not great. 
278,93,Griffin, What did you get? 
279,93,Travis," Uh, it’s only a five, so I can’t read shit. "
280,93,Griffin," On a five I make a hard move against you. I would say unless somebody wants to help out, I would only give you a plus one, and would open them up to sort of— another bad thing that could happen. So you don’t really notice anything— you don’t really notice anything bad, Aubrey. You don’t seem to notice anything magical, you get the sense that you didn’t— you weren’t necessarily attuned, but you— you don’t notice anything. "
281,93,Travis," Hmm. Then instead, I’ll turn to my friend and rookie partner, Jake Coolice. "
282,93,Jake," So, what’s the plan? You need me to take the Deputy out so you all can get a look at the crash site, or—? "
283,93,Aubrey," What? No. Not yet. Here’s my question for you, Jake. You know this area, you know the weather, right? You know snow, and the woods, and stuff. Do you notice anything— trees, broken limbs, uh, you know, anything like that? "
284,93,Jake, There’s something weird. 
285,93,Aubrey, Okay? 
286,93,Griffin," And he points to the snow, and he says, "
287,93,Jake," I know snow. I know what a nice sort of coating of fresh powder looks like, right? It cakes down, and it forms kind of a solid surface. "
288,93,Griffin," And he points kind of down the— down the hillside, not really where the car crashed but just off to the hillside, and you do see just sort of this carpet of snow, just everywhere. But it’s not like— it’s not flat, it’s not perfectly flat. It almost looks like pockmarked. It almost looks like there’s just kind of— there’s little, very very small divots that you definitely would not have noticed if Jake had not pointed them out to you. But there’s something sort of peculiar, it’s not just this perfect, flat sheet of snow. There’s pockmarks. "
289,93,Travis," So not, like— not like, footsteps small? "
290,93,Griffin," No, no, no, like way way way smaller than that. "
291,93,Travis, Is it in any kind of trail? 
292,93,Griffin," Nope. Just kind of all over. I think that’s it. Ned, you want to do anything? "
293,93,Clint," I have questions about the body. I have questions about what killed the Danimal, but I don’t if this is the place or if Dewey would have any insight on— "
294,93,Justin, That seems to be a stretch for Dewey to reveal the… 
295,93,Clint, Yeah…
296,93,Griffin," Well, Dewey did say he died from impact of the car crash, he did say that to Duck."
297,93,Travis, What the fuck does Dewey know?
298,93,Griffin," Yeah, I mean he probably saw the body."
299,93,Justin," Ned’s a car guy, right? Have we established that?"
300,93,Clint," Yeah, he is actually."
301,93,Griffin," Yeah, for sure!"
302,93,Duck," Ned, take a look at this van and I know it’s a little bit fucked up but…  Do you see any reason that the brakes in this van would not have worked?"
303,93,Griffin," As you all approach the van, Dewey steps in front of you and he says, "
304,93,Dewey," Now, hold on guys. We do need to still sort of do— "
305,93,Aubrey," Dewey, was it?"
306,93,Dewey, Yeah.
307,93,Aubrey," Dewey, do you like magic?"
308,93,Dewey," [laughing] Hell yeah, I like magic! David Blaine, fuckin, uh— "
309,93,Aubrey, Yeah!
310,93,Dewey," Yeah, he does this thing where he spits up— he barfs up the frog, I’ve seen that— makes me wanna barf!"
311,93,Aubrey," Yeah, right? And like— would you like to see— I’m… I don’t wanna brag, but— "
312,93,Justin," Alright, they’re having this conversation, I’m— "
313,93,Griffin," No, I’m gonna need Aubrey to roll to… probably Manipulate Someone. Uh, and that is the reason that you’re doing— once you’ve given them a reason, the reason is, “Do you wanna see some cool magic?”, and what you want is to distract them, so [crosstalk] that Ned can investigate the car."
314,93,Travis, [crosstalk] I rolled an 11 plus 1.
315,93,Griffin, Holy shit!
316,93,Justin," Hachi machi, that’s some good fuckin’ magic."
317,93,Griffin," So, they will do it for the reason that you gave them."
318,93,Dewey," Ah, shit yeah!"
319,93,Griffin," Where are you, like, leading them to?"
320,93,Travis," I’m basically just like, you know, whatever keeps his back to the car, that’s what we’re doing. I also will say, how distracted is he? Oh, I know what trick I’m gonna do! I’m gonna make his badge disappear! [Justin laughs] Because it’s a law keeper’s symbol."
321,93,Griffin, Okay.
322,93,Justin," Ah, shit, I love that. Oh, that’s so good."
323,93,Griffin," Alright, let’s play that out."
324,93,Aubrey," Okay, now Dewey, I’m gonna need something "
325,93,"from you. Something important. What on you right now is something that you would not only hate to lose, but maybe would get in trouble.",
326,93,Dewey," Oh, my gun?"
327,93,Aubrey," …Well, maybe not, Dewey. Maybe not a gun."
328,93,Dewey," Oh yeah, yeah, no, you’re right, I’m sorry, that was dumb. I can’t give you my gun!"
329,93,Aubrey, Yeah.
330,93,Dewey," I don’t know what kinda David Blaine trick you’re gonna do with my gun, but I got my— I got my wallet, I got my keys, I got my badge, I got my phone."
331,93,Aubrey," Let me see the badge, that should be just about the right size."
332,93,Griffin," He hands it over, he says,"
333,93,Dewey," Alright, but be careful— I don’t think I can get a replacement one, and Zeke’ll be pissed as hell if I lose that."
334,93,Aubrey," Oh, I totally understand, I’ve never blown this trick before."
335,93,Travis," So while this is happening, Ned’s investigating the car, right?"
336,93,Griffin," Alright, we can jump over to that. Ned and Duck are by the van."
337,93,Clint," Alright, so Ned takes off his big, puffy, red-yellow-and-blue vest. [Griffin Okay.] And does uh, an investigate check under the van."
338,93,Griffin," Uhh yeah, go ahead and investigate a mystery, I’m gonna give you plus one forward, because like you have this driver tag that hasn't especially come in handy, ever, but you do have like car auto experience. "
339,93,Clint," Alright yeah, so I rolled a six, plus the one, would be seven, plus two for sharp, which I get to use here too."
340,93,Griffin," Brings you up to nine and uh, Duck, if you want to help him out somehow, we can get that up to a 10. Um, if you wanna roll Help Out and explain how you are helping out— or Aubrey, if you wanna roll Help Out as sort of your distraction. But you all— I don’t think we’ve ever done Help Out, but you can get this from a Mixed Success to a Complete Success if you can tell me how you are helping Ned."
341,93,Justin," Um… yeah, lemme try— Do you want me to see if it works first before I waste time telling him? [Clint laughs]"
342,93,Griffin," No, I mean— here’s the thing, if you decide to help out, and it doesn’t work, then there is still a thing that happens, it’s just probably not gonna be great. "
343,93,Justin," Um, "
344,93,Duck," Ned, you should know that Rick was a real safe driver and he would’ve taken really good care of his car. I— [sighs] I’ll tell you what I’m thinking I just don’t believe that he would’ve done something this reckless. It just doesn’t seem like him."
345,93,Griffin," Alright, yeah, telling him a little bit about Rick, I think will help. Um, go ahead and roll [crosstalk] Plus Cool for Help Out."
346,93,Justin, [crosstalk] I did. It’s a ten. [Clint Ooh!]
347,93,Griffin," It’s a ten, okay. On a ten, your help grants them plus one to their roll. So that brings you up to a ten on your investigate a mystery [crosstalk] so that allows you to— "
348,93,Justin," [crosstalk] Plus two, so that’s 12."
349,93,Griffin," Oh shit, cool. Uh, so hold two, Ned, and you get to ask two questions off the Investigate a Mystery roll. Keeping in mind that, like, you’re just looking at a car, and so there’s a lot of stuff on here that’s probably not gonna— not gonna be especially relevant."
350,93,Clint," Alright, tell me— how do I word this, I’m going to investigate, really check out the brakes. [Griffin Okay.] Check out the brake line and— "
351,93,Griffin," The pedal, and just that whole brake system."
352,93,Clint," The whole brake thing, yeah."
353,93,Griffin," Okay, so that would be— "
354,93,Travis," God, it’s like listening to Car Talk over here. [Clint and Griffin laughing]"
355,93,Clint," [nasally voice] “What do we got, the pads? Check the pads! Are the pads alright?”"
356,93,Travis," [same nasally voice] “I’m gonna look at the brake gum, and the sticky widgets.”"
357,93,Griffin," Um, I think that would be a What Happened Here, so… yeah, so you check out the brake system. Underneath the car, and under the hood, there is— there’s nothing wrong. The brake system is totally fine. You know, the brake line is working, there’s brake fluid, everything seems very well and just in good operating order. Uh, mechanically speaking. You go and you check out the actual brake pedal, and the brake pedal is also fine. But while you’re down there, sort of looking around— and again, the front of the car is pretty well crumpled up, and I think you have a hard time even getting into the driver’s compartment to look at the pedals, you see something— I think, actually, it’s been moved over to the passenger side— there’s some bottles, like plastic bottles of, like, Gatorade— I think Rick was a big Gatorade fan, and so there’s just a few bottles of Gatorade. And there’s one that looks peculiar, um, that is over in the passenger side floor. And you pick it up, and it’s been kind of crushed— it’s been crushed, like, right in the center of the bottle, in like a very specific way, almost looks like it got stomped on. And as you are sort of looking at it, and you look at the brake pedal, you kind of surmise that the indent of the crush of this bottle is the exact same height of the brake pedal. And so you figure out what happened here is that this bottle got wedged under the brake pedal, and probably kept Rick from being able to brake. And so, just this freak accident kept him from being able to brake the car, and sent him to his demise. [crosstalk] You have one more question—"
358,93,Clint," [crosstalk] Wow. That’s some Columbo shit, right there."
359,93,Griffin," Well, you rolled a ten. You got one more question."
360,93,Clint," What about the grill? As long as I’m in full blown Columbo mode, let me check out the grill. "
361,93,Griffin," Um, okay. I don’t think there’s— yeah, there’s nothing really supernatural about the grill. There’s nothing especially weird, it just kind of looks like— and again, you’re not a forensic analyst, but it just kind of looks like this van hit a tree very hard, and got very messed up because of it. One thing— Duck, you are sort of there talking to Ned— one thing I think you noticed through the window into the van, and I don’t think this is investigate a mystery, because it’s just very, very apparent, it’s not something you would have to dig especially deep to realize The van is empty. And he was an arborist, meaning he was responsible for if there was something seriously wrong with a tree, or some sort of rot that was plaguing the trees in the Monongahela forest, he would have like a lot of tools that he would use to, you know, safely scale the trees and prune it or help deal with it— there’s nothing in the van. All of these supplies and all of these tools are gone. They are not in the van."
362,93,Ned," Duck, my friend, I— I’m afraid that deep down body thirst cost your friend, Danimal, his life. [Griffin laughing] Looks like a bottle of Gatorade went behind the brake pedal and so [Duck sighs] this really does look like an accident. I think it also goes to prove that trying to stay in shape is bad for you, so."
363,93,Travis, The sour milk has claimed another victim.
364,93,Griffin, The sour sweat potion.
365,93,Duck," I, um… Ned, I appreciate it. I really— we do need to talk about your still-held belief that Gatorade is part of a healthy lifestyle, but we’ll get— I think there’s time for that. I, um, I appreciate you checking, anyway. You know, it was just a thought. "
366,93,Ned," It does look like an accident, though."
367,93,Duck, Yep.
368,93,Griffin," Aubrey, let’s finish your badge theft, if this is something you wanna go through with. Again, these are side missions that you don’t have to do, it just helps you later on [crosstalk] with your Enchantment roll, but— "
369,93,Travis," [crosstalk] Griffin, I am a fucking completionist."
370,93,Griffin," Yeah, I know, you wanna 100% this. [crosstalk] You wanna get all the towers—"
371,93,Travis, [crosstalk] You can’t give me side missions. I’m gonna get all the feathers [Griffin Sure] I’m gonna get all the flags. [Griffin laughing]
372,93,Griffin," Alright, um, so, what’s this trick look like? ‘Cause I can’t just let you say, “I do a magic trick, and now I have his badge.” There’s has to be some sort of challenge to it."
373,93,Travis," So I would say that there is a lot of like palming, but mostly it’s like, “Oh sorry, I thought it was here— oh, is it there?” You know, like, misdirect, his keys are now where his wallet was, and his wallet is now where that was, and that kind of thing. [Griffin Okay] And there’s just a lot of patter, and I will say that now that he has introduced that he is a big David Blaine fan, I’m gonna go for kind of a David Blaine feeling reveal."
374,93,Griffin, You’re gonna eat the badge?
375,93,Travis. …No! ,
376,93,Griffin," I mean, that’s what David would do, but okay."
377,93,Travis," I mean, the reveal— well, the lie, is something along the lines of,"
378,93,Aubrey," Alright, and boom! There you go, Dewey."
379,93,Dewey," …There what goes? Where’s my— where is it? You’re supposed to [Aubrey Yeah] teleport it into an orange or somethin’, I cut into the orange to have myself a little citrus snack and then, damn, there’s my badge."
380,93,Aubrey," Dewey, I guarantee you by the end of the day, you— your mind? It’s gonna be blown. "
381,93,Dewey," What does that mean, though? [crosstalk] ‘Cause I do— "
382,93,Aubrey, [crosstalk] Yeah. David Blaine.
383,93,Dewey," No, I’m tantalized, I’m just like [crosstalk] you promi— "
384,93,Aubrey, [crosstalk] You’ve been Blained. I just freaked your bean. 
385,93,Dewey," No, totally, but by the end of the day, you’re telling me [Aubrey Yeah] I’m gonna find my badge again and Sheriff Zeke’s not gonna— "
386,93,Aubrey, Well… I think you’ll be very surprised. Wink wink. [Griffin laughing]
387,93,Travis," She says, she says wink wink. But she doesn’t wink. [Griffin Okay]"
388,93,Dewey," Alright. Well, I— "
389,93,Aubrey, [magic noises] 
390,93,Travis," And then maybe like, there’s a little flash. But it’s flash paper, this isn’t real magic. [Griffin Okay] No, no, no."
391,93,Griffin," He says,"
392,93,Dewey," Alright, well, I’ll keep an eye out. I guess I’ll keep—"
393,93,Aubrey, [magic noises]
394,93,Dewey," Okay, alright, that actually hurts my eyes a little bit when you do it that close."
395,93,Aubrey," Yeah. Magic, ooh. Dewey, magic?"
396,93,Dewey," Yeah, yeah, for sure. Alright, why don’t y’all head back to town, I’m seriously gonna get in my car ‘cause I’m just so fucking cold. "
397,93,Griffin," Um, and as he sort of turns to walk back to the car, I think Ned and Duck, you all are already on your way back from the van. And he tips his cap and he says,"
398,93,Dewey," Alright, um, y’all have a good day. Duck, again, I’m real sorry. I hope this doesn’t ruin your holidays, pal. "
399,93,Duck," Yeah, thanks, I appreciate it."
400,93,Griffin," Uh, and he gets in his car."
401,93,Aubrey," Psst, Duck. I stole his badge? Am I gonna get in trouble?"
402,93,Duck," Aw, man, I wish you hadn’t done that."
403,93,Aubrey," It’s for the, it’s for— ‘cause on the card?"
404,93,Duck," I know, Aubrey [crosstalk] I get it."
405,93,Aubrey, [crosstalk] You said it was a badge! 
406,93,Duck," Dewey’s a nice guy, I don’t know."
407,93,Aubrey, I’ll make it up to him!
408,93,Duck," Alright, but Zeke’s gonna have his ass, I don’t know how you’re gonna fix that, but… "
409,93,Aubrey," Then I’ll steal Zeke’s badge, and I’ll give Zeke’s badge to Dewey— "
410,93,Duck, Great. Yes. That’s— 
411,93,Ned," Oh, this web of lies! [Justin and Clint laughing]"
412,93,Griffin," Um… you all drive away from the scene of the crash, and Dewey gets back into his car, and sits there for a while. I think he looks around his car for a while, looking to see if maybe you teleported his badge somewhere in his car, but he doesn’t find it. So he kinda sighs and smiles, like, ‘Oh no, where’s it gonna show up?’ Um, and then we sort of— we see the crash from the woods, up the hill, from above the crash, and there we see a figure on a snowmobile. And this figure is wearing a helmet, and was watching this scene intently, as it played out. Saw everything that happened, saw Ned and Duck investigating this car crash, and they probably should’ve seen— saw Aubrey stealing the badge of a sheriff’s deputy. And as you all drive off in the Lincoln, they turn the snowmobile and drive off back into the woods."
413,93,Travis, Is it one of them fucking Hornets?
414,93,Griffin," [sing-song] Hard move~! [speaking] So, uh, night starts to sort of descend as you all drive back down state route 66 and into town— you pass the turnoff into the Cryptonomica, and sort of drive into Kepler’s riverside. And those Christmas lights are sort of streaking by as you drive across the main drag toward the ascent back up to Amnesty Lodge on cliffside. And the temperature now that the sun is down has just plummeted, the streets are clear, nobody really wants to be out when it’s this cold. And then a single flake falls on the windshield of your car. And then it is followed by a sudden, frenzied storm, that starts to just completely cover your view. Outside, through the windows and the windshield, you can just barely see this storm being whipped about— these flakes are just being flung almost horizontally in your direction. And through this, you all see a figure, just for a moment, on the side of the road. It is a humanoid figure, wearing a brown robe that covers its entire, imposing frame. And, from a distance, you’d estimate to be easily eight feet tall, with broad shoulders and thick muscular arms. It’s got these two large bags of some sort, slung over its shoulders. And you can’t see its face behind the hood of its robe, but it stops and it turns to face you as you pass, just as the storm outside finally and completely covers your view. And then Ned, the engine of the Lincoln sputters in this storm, and then it backfires a few times, and then it just dies. And your car rolls to a stop. And then, moments later, the storm just completely disappears. What do you do?"
415,93,Aubrey, Was it the Krampus?
416,93,Travis, [whispers] Griffin?
417,93,Griffin, I’m not gonna tell you if it’s the Krampus or not. But [mumbling] it’s probably not the Krampus.
418,93,Travis, [doubtful] Okay. That’s what the Krampus would say.
419,93,Griffin, [laughing] I’m gonna have to tell you if it’s the Krampus or else it’s entrapment.
420,93,Travis," Okay, thank you."
421,93,Clint, I can tell you who it was… it was Michael Jordan!
422,93,[gasps],
423,93,Travis," Hurry, masturbate him!"
424,93,Griffin," Jake Cool-Ice actually says, "
425,93,Jake," So, uh, you all saw that too, right?"
426,93,Aubrey," That had the two scary bags? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
427,93,Ned, Did anybody notice if the bags were moving or not? ‘Cause that would be so much more creepy.
428,93,Jake," Um, no, I didn’t see anything like that… Ned, is the car done-zo? What— "
429,93,Ned," I don’t know! You know, a lot of this me knowing cars is such hogwash anyway [Justin laughing] I mean, it looks like it’s full of gas, the radiator thing looks like it’s got radiator juice in it. I— god, where is the hood release? I can never find the hood release."
430,93,Travis," Okay, Aubrey gets out."
431,93,Griffin," Okay. Um, as you step outside you see that, indeed, there is no storm, there is just— it is just gone completely. Ned’s car has rolled to a stop in the middle of the street, sort of right in the heart of riverside. You just passed city hall and the massive Christmas tree out in front, and the few municipal buildings surrounding it. And on the other side of the main drag you’re on is a handful of the town’s staple businesses. There’s like a winter sports supply store, a Dave’s Dehumidifier Depot is here, Leo Turkesian’s general store is here, the Pizza Hut is here, it’s got this like towering, illuminated sign beckoning in drivers off the highway. And everything is just quiet."
432,93,Travis," And so we don’t see the figure now, right?"
433,93,Griffin, It is gone. But you are fairly close by to where you just saw it.
434,93,Travis," Okay, well, I guess we go check out that area."
435,93,Griffin," You say ‘we’, is it you and [Aubrey Well] Duck, are you heading with her?"
436,93,Justin, Yeah.
437,93,Griffin," Yeah, I don’t even think you need to investigate this, because I don’t think you necessarily need to— again, I think when there are things that are just obvious that you can just see with your eyes, and don’t require any sort of additional investigation, you don’t need to roll. You see tracks in the ground. You see hoofprints [Aubrey gasps] in the ground."
438,93,Aubrey, I knew it!
439,93,Griffin," And as you’re sort of standing there looking at these hoofprints that just sort of disappear from the place where they were standing, where you saw this figure— there is a payphone not too far away from where you are, about 10 feet away. And it starts to ring."
440,93,Travis, I look at Duck.
441,93,Duck, Yeah?
442,93,Aubrey, You get it.
443,93,Duck, You get it!
444,93,Aubrey, You— 
445,93,Ned, [shouting] Somebody get the phone!
446,93,Aubrey, Okay. I’ll get it.
447,93,Griffin," You pick up the phone Aubrey, and a… sort of pleasant, sort of lilting voice answers, and this voice says,"
448,93,Unidentified Voice," Hello, Aubrey. Can I speak to Duck Newton, please?"
449,93,Aubrey," Uh, lemme see if he’s here. [Clint laughs] It’s for you?"
450,93,[The Adventure Zone, Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
451,93,Duck," Uh, go for Duck?"
452,93,Griffin," You take the phone and the voice says,"
453,93,Unidentified Voice," Hello, Duck. In three minutes, your friend Leo Tarkesian is going to die. [Travis gasps] He will be crushed to death, as will the two customers currently shopping in his store. You might want to do something about that."
