7,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Hey everybody, this is Griffin. Real quick, before we get into this episode, I wanted to give you a heads up that the audio is not amazing. This is our live show from Tacoma, and the levels were a little bit too hot, and it’s a little bit blown out because of that. It’s still totally listenable, but it’s not really up to snuff, and I’m very sorry about that. I hope you enjoy it regardless. We still really wanted to put it out, because this is our Candlenights episode, and it was a lot of fun to record, and we wanted you to hear it anyway. But I wanted to give you a heads up, that, yeah, the levels aren’t super super great. But, yeah, we’ll be back next week, though! "
8,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"If you haven’t heard, we’re going to be trying to go weekly, starting in January, with the rest of the experimental arcs, and I’m going to be running the next one, and i’m really excited for you to hear it. So the next one, the next episode you hear is going to be our Setup episode for my next arc, and that is going to go up on Thursday, January 4th. So go ahead and listen to our Candlenights Adventure, and I’ll be back with the commercial break here in a bit!",

12,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Alright, so I’ve got a poem I wrote to walk us into the adventure tonight. Uh, and if you could go ahead and play the… Poem Background Music? [sleigh bells jingle and continue under Griffin’s poem] There we go. [audience laughs] "
13,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"“‘Twas the night before Candlenights, ",

15,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Oh, that’s a little loud. [laughs]"

63,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{0,0333} [Poem Background Music ends]
64,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Griffin, I didn’t have a pen, could you repeat that?"
65,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," So the three of you are standing before the entrance to Icekeep, a frozen, subterranean dungeon past the hills surrounding New Phandalin. The call-to-arms put out by the village’s mayor attracted countless parties who sought to silence the voice in this dungeon-- a voice the three of you hear loud and clear calling from the depths. But none of those parties ever returned."
66,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [goofy voice] Come on into my dungeon. [audience laughs] Is that what it sounds like?
67,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, No.
68,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, No it sounds like–
69,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," I like to party with my peeps, cruise ‘n creep, playing Three-Card Monty in these crazy streets. [audience laughs]"
70,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Way too many of you are like “I get it!”
71,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Yeah, how do you know what that is?"
72,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, You’re monsters.
73,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Justin has made us watch the intro to The Pest, the horrible movie, like 70 times today. In your trademark hubris the three of you assume that you might have better luck at silencing this voice. And it’s like a crying voice, like a deep like [Griffin sobs in a deep voice] but it’s super loud and maybe scary. The entrance is built into the side of a massive glacier a hundred yards or so ahead of you, but you can barely see it through the massive snowstorm that’s been covering the land for weeks now. However, there are other shapes in the snow that stand before you and the entrance, shapes that you can not quite make out through the storm. Everybody roll a perception check for me."
74,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," My die is flashing. [audience cheers] That means– hey folks, if you cheer for every 20 I roll tonight, that will probably be the last one. I can see everything, Griffin. I can see individual snowflake shapes!"
75,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Taako, you can clearly see–"
76,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [interrupting] I got a 16.
77,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Taako sees it the best. 
78,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I got a 2. [audience cheers]
79,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," There’s very cold, weird rain falling from the sky. Um, Taako, you can clearly– and Magnus, but Taako the best– you can clearly make out what these shapes in the snow are. You see razor-sharp icicles jutting out of the ground, stabbing 10 feet upward into the sky, turning the snowfield in front of you between you and the entrance to Icekeep into something of a grisly scene because impaled on a number of these icicles are skeletons, nearly frozen in the storm, their rotted adventuring gear still hing off their lifeless forms."
80,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Here’s what I want you to picture we all see that, and I just sloooowly reach to my belt and turn it to “ice”."
81,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. [beat as the audience laughs] Shit. I didn’t even think about…
82,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, And so do I.
83,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You don’t have a magic immunity belt. Uh, OK, Magnus will take half damage on ice attacks. Fuck. Uh, so that is the situation. There is a field of sharp icicles jutting out 10 feet into the sky between you and the entrance to this glacier that you really still can’t quite see."
84,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Let’s go!
85,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, What do you do?
86,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Magnus rushes in. [audience cheers] I mean I– Can I tell you at this point, I, a more mature, adult Travis don’t want to rush in, but I’ve painted myself into a corner, fictionally speaking."
87,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Roll a dexterity saving throw for me."
88,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [groans] That’s an 11… Plus two, though! So 13– Wait, saving throw? Yeah, that’s plus two, so that’s a 13."
89,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, an icicle, as you take your first step into this snowfield, shoots out of the snow and jabs you right through the shoulder and you take… 22, or 11, points of ice damage."
90,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I don’t have a pen, so I’ll just remember–"
91,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No. Do we have a pen backstage Sam, or– [at this point, someone in the audience throws a pen onto the stage] oh, OK! "
92,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Oh god! 
93,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Nobody else! OK, I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say– This is an important PSA never throw things at people while they’re performing on a stage. But that was the best fucking pen throw, it landed perfectly on the table."
94,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," You did crit that– Stand up, who threw that? "
95,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Security! Security!
96,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] I feel bad.
97,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I’m impressed!
98,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Get them out of here, they threw something at performers on a stage! "
99,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, OK. 
100,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Alright.
101,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Nah, they’re cool. It’s fine."
102,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," They’re cool, it’s fine. That was a joke. "
103,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, But was it? No more throwing things.
104,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Oh and hey, security, where were you all on that one? I kind of expected a sort of–"
105,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I mean, it turned out fine, but–"
106,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, A clear and present danger.
107,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yeah, I want to see bodies flying and [slow-motion deep voice] “Noooooo”"
108,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, Magnus, you are impaled."
109,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Owwww.
110,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, By a pen! 
111,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[Griffin laughing],
112,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus,"  Alright, everybody, this– Apparently there’s icicles and they’re mad."
113,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Now is he stuck there?
114,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, I mean you could probably break it off."
115,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," So when he hit it, icicles fell down?"
116,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Came up from the snow.
117,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Oh cool, it’s like a trap!"
118,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
119,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Yeah. Cool.
120,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, so the only thing we have to do to avoid this trap is turn around and leave."
121,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Would be a short show. These people waited a long time.
122,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m waiting for one of the other two of you to do something.
123,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yeah, I’m just gonna, uh, use a little item I call the Hole Thrower and throw a hole into it."
124,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Into what?
125,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," The ice. There’s like a– you can’t get past, right? The way you described it–"
126,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Nononono. Let me– I’ve failed.
127,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Weave your tapestry again, sorcerer."
128,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," There is a large field of snow, and there’s icicles coming up out of it. It’s not forming a barrier or anything, you can get past. It’s just, Magnus took one step into it and an icicle-"
129,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Oh, sh–"
130,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And when it impaled my shoulder, am I lifted off the ground? Am I kind of dangling?"
131,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, you’re burly enough that it doesn’t quite, uh, raise you up. "
132,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, OK so I’m still on my feet and it’s through the back and Taako’s like “So what’s going on? What happens?”
133,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Um, OK, I’m gonna cast– How far is it? Is there an entrance?"
134,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," About 100 yards. Yeah, you can see, there’s a door, you can barely make it out in the side of this glacier 100 yards ahead of you."
135,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I am going to... cast... a spell…
136,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Called...?
137,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Called… Continual Flame. I’m gonna cast Continual Flame on the tip of the Umbra Staff.
138,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Shit.
139,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And I’m going– So that will make it into a flame except it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. [audience laughs] OK, so I do that, I make a thing that looks like a fire, and then I– and then I’m like “This gives me an idea!” Stupid. I cast Investiture of Flame."
140,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Invest in some flame.
141,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Flames surround me in a 30-foot radius for the spell’s duration. That’s really powerful to traverse a dumb trap, isn’t it?"
142,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{0,1104}
143,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, I like it. ‘Cause we’ve been on it for about 30 minutes now."
144,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, so I cast Investiture of Flame, there’s a 30-foot radius– um I–"
145,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, How’re your boys doin’? Are your boys–?
146,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, they’re in my bubble!"
147,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK.
148,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And, um–"
149,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," I think Magnus, roll a dexterity saving throw to get in his bubble because I think–"
150,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, I have spell shaping, so I would shape it around him."
151,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I got a 15.
152,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, you’re fine. [exasperated] You don’t have spell shaping anymore, I don’t know how many times I have to tell you–"
153,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I do have spell shaping.
154,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," When you– God, OK, when you specced as a transmutation wizard, you don’t have spell shaping, that’s an evocation wizard thing. Come on! Alright, so anyway–"
155,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Who can say for sure when this story takes place?
156,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, A whir– Do you guys wanna be level 1? [Travis No…] A whirlwind of flames surrounds Taako and the other two and reveals some dead grass below your feet as the snow melts away and it catches some of the–
157,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Any loose change?
158,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, there’s probably some che that’s fallen out of–"
159,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, How much exactly in gold?
160,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Not much, like 7 gold."
161,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Count ‘em.
162,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Nice. That’ll get you a sandwich and a hot cocoa.
163,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," But as soon as it touches these icicles they also melt away, so you are protected from any more icicles. You’ve solved my icicle puzzle. "
164,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Thank you. I can’t finish if you don’t say it. Finish the puzzle. You monsters. OK, so we sprint towards the entrance."
165,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," As you approach the entrance, the snowstorm picks up, and I’m assuming the spell has died down by now, and you’re not just going to be surrounded by flame for the whole episode. The snowstorm picks up and it’s biting at your face with these chilling winds"
166,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Brrrr.
167,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And you’re standing before the doors leading into this glacier and they are massive 20 foot high double doors carved from oak. And they’re surrounded by this enormous 1 foot deep metal archway covered in runes and emblems resembling snowflakes that just wraps around the whole double door. Everybody make a perception check again.
168,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I got an 18.
169,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,J2ustin, Got a 5 on that one.
170,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, 19 total. 
171,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," TWO! [audience laughs] I swear to god, it’s a 2. "
172,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Why would you lie about that?
173,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I don’t know.
174,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, If it’s a 1?
175,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, To lean into the mythology a little bit. 
176,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, you can’t quite make it out exactly, but you can see faintly, just barely, through the storm, a figure on top of this metal archway surrounding the door, like 20 feet up, and it seems like they’re tinkering with something up there, and thanks to the snow they haven’t– despite the fact that you just wreathed yourself in flame– they haven’t seen you yet."
177,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Hey!
178,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, You yell “hey” and you hear a loud click from the top of the archway.
179,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, What are you doing?
180,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And–
181,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Are you picking a lock?
182,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And then–
183,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Because we want to go in, too! We can hear a voice, can you hear a voice?"
184,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, Are you an elf?
185,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," You can’t see THEM, too!"
186,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," I can’t? Oh yeah, right."
187,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,        Merle, Who are you talking to?
188,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,        Magnus," Shut up, Merle!"
189,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, that’s what neither of your characters sound like. These people paid a lot of money to see– to come see us, so if you could."
190,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,        Magnus, [in a deep Magnus Voice] Hey!
191,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Oh, god, we’re on that again."
192,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Uh–
193,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Not again, still on it."
194,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, as you yell “hey”, as you yell that, you hear a startled yelp come from up there and suddenly the figure falls backwards off the arch."
195,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Oh, no, that was a 2, did not catch him."
196,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Tumbling down and down, and it’s stopped in midair by three icicles that shoot upward, impaling and killing them instantly. And you can see this figure now it’s a man, a very large man."
197,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [high-pitched groaning]
198,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, A very large man with a bushy white beard and a tummy like a bowl full of jelly. He’s wearing a red suit and hat and–
199,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [laughing, obviously slightly distressed] You killed Santa!"
200,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Now hold on, fuck you, is this The Santa Clause?"
201,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And he’s carrying a large bag made of canvas and moments after he’s impaled, that suit and hat and bag is all that’s left of him as his body disappears."
202,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Fuck you, Griffin. [audience cheers as Griffin, Clint, and Justin start laughing] My brother, the monster."
203,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," His body just disappears leaving the clothes and bag crumpled in a heap at your feet, and on top of this pile, a golden scroll materializes out of the air with the words Read Me scrawled on the side in intricate letters."
204,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I turn to Merle.
205,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the letter opens up, actually, and a voice reads out loud"
206,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Dead Santa," If you’re reading this, it means that I have died."
207,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [in deep Santa voice] Completely by accident and nobody’s fault.
208,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Dead Santa," If you’re reading this, it means I have died. Hopefully not by your hands, because that would be very, very naughty. Ho, ho, ho. A little joke!"
209,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [in deep Santa voice] But I am dead, so like, bummer."
210,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"My name is Santa Claus, and if you’re reading this, then I’ve got news for you, pal"," now your name is Santa Claus. This mantle that I have upheld for decades has been passed down to you, just as it was passed down to me. It’s a very important mantle, my new friend. Santa Claus is responsible for spreading the spirit of Candlenights throughout the land by delivering toys and gifts to all the young people of the world. "
211,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, How big is this fucking scroll?
212,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It’s pretty big.
213,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis,  [in deep Santa voice] “Turn over”.
214,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Dead Santa," During my time as Santa, I have delivered millions of presents to those innocent souls deserving of them. I might have even delivered some of you– some to you, friend, in your youth. But seeing as how I am now dead as disco, I think it’s time to confess something. For several years now, I have neglected that sacred charge for one child in particular, and I have done so because that child dwells in the Icekeep, a place I am very, very afraid of! Ho, ho ho! When reports reached me about the crying from Icekeep, I knew that my dereliction of duty was the cause, and so I have decided to set right my terrible oversight and deliver a present to this sad and lonely child. But if you’re reading this, I guess I didn’t do a very good job. Ho, ho. I hope my death was quick and painless. "
215,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"It falls to you now, friend, to succeed where I have failed. Don my suit and my holiday Bag of Holding and venture within Icekeep to deliver this fateful Candlenights present. Now, I don’t know what kind of youngster waits for you down there, nor do I have any idea what kind of gift that youngster will desire. The holiday Bag of Holding can produce any gift that its owner desires, so I am hoping you’ll be wise enough to figure it out once you get in there. It’s imperative you don’t abuse this power though. That kinda goes against the reason for the season. Well, that’s it, I guess! Time to get busy living or get busy dying. Looks like I’m stuck doing the latter. Ho, ho, ho.",
216,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, S.C.
217,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," You know, that was a weirdly specific letter."
218,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Wasn’t it? Yeah.
219,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," Is he– Does this mean Santa Claus, every time he leaves the house, is recording a new death note? Like–"
220,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, “I was just getting some milk.”
221,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," “Heading to Piggly Wiggly now, hope I don’t die! Anyway…”"
222,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," “About to eat a big plate of chicken wings, hope I don’t choke to death!”"
223,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Raise Dead. [audience cheers]
224,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah. There’s no body. I KNEW you were gonna do that, I made the body disappear! [audience cheers louder]"
225,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," You can fuck off, old man!"
226,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Shit!
227,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Always trying to destroy my plots. Also, that spell takes a day to cast. OK–"
228,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, What else are we doing?
229,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," There’s a Santa suit, there’s–"
230,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," I’m not putting it on. I’m not the Santa type, I think that goes to Merle."
231,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, [begrudgingly] I’ll put it on.
232,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Well hold on. Taako do you want to–?
233,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Is Tim Allen here? 
234,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," God, I hope not."
235,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [at the same time as Travis] Thankfully no.
236,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Probably not.
237,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Taako, do you want to be Santa?"
238,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako, I’m not a bear.
239,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [as the audience starts cheering] Ah, thank you."
240,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Alright, Merle."
241,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Yeah, I’ll do it."
242,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," As you put on the Santa suit, Merle, a glowing enchantment surrounds you and this light glows around you brightly, and as it fades you realize that the suit has been tailored to fit you perfectly, and you also notice that your beard is sort of [stammers] a grey, scraggly beard, with probably some twigs and leaves and other–"
243,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And like, 7."
244,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And shit. It’s actually now this huge, bushy white beard that-"
245,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint and Travis, A big bushy beard!
246,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And it’s a real beard, it’s not just stuck on."
247,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I pull it.
248,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That light–
249,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I pull it.
250,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It hurts.
251,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, OW! I-I’m sorry [Merle voice] OW!
252,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Thank you. And then that light–
253,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I pull it harder.
254,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Owww, OWW, SHIT!"
255,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, It’s real!
256,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Let him weave his tapestry.
257,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yes, and then that light that’s surrounding you, Merle Santa, uh, it shoots out of your body and it surrounds your two friends and when it fades from them, you see their wardrobe has ched too. They’re now wearing these green, kind of silly outfits [Clint starts laughing] with jester’s hats and jingle bells and boots that curl up at the toes. [Clint is absolutely losing his shit]"
258,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Oh, god, I love these liveshows."
259,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And with that, the mechanism that Santa was activating– I didn’t think about this, but Santa? Master thief. Uh, was activating-"
260,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, He does sneak into houses.
261,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," That’s true. That he was working on at the top of the arch stops whirring, and as it does the double doors into the Icekeep sweep outward, granting you access to a hallway of rough cobblestones leading downward. And after travelling down this hall for several hundred feet, the corridor ends at a sheet of thick ice, which as you approach it, slides upward."
262,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, I assume there’s tiny bells on our shoes?"
263,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Oh absolutely. [Travis starts making little ting noises] So stealth checks are just out of the question.
264,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, OK.
265,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Uh, OK, we’ve been going for about 20, 25 minutes now, in case anyone was stuck in traffic, let me catch you up We killed Santa, and now my dad is Santa, and we’re elves, and we’re trying to find a little kid in an ice cave to give him a present. That’s pretty much everything."
266,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Thank you, Justin."
267,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And I cast a 6th-level spell, so if I- If you’re keeping track of that."
268,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And as you enter the chamber just beyond this sliding ice door, it slides back down cutting off your exit. Bringing us to the second section of the adventure that, I’ll be honest, I thought we were gonna get to just- way faster. You take a moment to survey this new chamber. It’s a cavernous, circular room, the exterior wall of which is made of smooth, thick ice. The floor is made of stone, but you can barely see it through the thick carpet of snow that covers this room up to your ankles. Flanking the central diameter of this room are two snow banks that extend 10 feet and raise all the way up to your waist. "
269,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"As you enter the room, you see something just off to your left"," another one of those sliding ice doors is in the process of closing, and for a moment you see three people behind it. Three aarakocra, to be precise, which is a race of humanoid bird-people. One is burly and carrying an axe with plate armor, one is more slight with two daggers and ragged leather armor, and one is shorter, carrying a staff and wearing a set of black robes. And you see them just for a moment as the door slides shut, you hear th–"
270,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Hi!
271,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, You hear their muffled conversation as they move deeper into the Icekeep. You hear one voice say
272,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Aarakocra 1," Awww, man. Looks like we’ve got company."
273,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,And another voice says,
274,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Aarakocra 2," We’d better hurry, we can’t let them get credit for this job."
275,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,And a third voice says,
276,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Aarakocra 3," Don’t sweat it, Ray. If they catch up to us, we’ll just kill them, too."
277,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,And on the other half of the room that you’re in–,
278,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I wanted bird friends, but they sound mean."
279,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yeah, they just sound mean."
280,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," On the other half of this circular room that you’re in, you see something, uh, else kind of strange. You see the snow start to whip up off the floor, and as it does, they unearth the bones and belongings of fallen adventurers below. And those bones start to rattle and reform themselves into two full, standing skeletons. And then the snow surrounds those skeletons, forming these thick, round bodies around them. The loot from those adventurers then lifts up off the ground and suddenly one of these snowmen is wearing a tophat and has a crude face made of gold coins, while the other–"
281,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Oh no, they killed Uncle Pennybags."
282,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," While the other has a leather helmet and a carrot for a nose. And after forming, these two snowmen pull spears of ice up out of the ground and emit a chilling roar. Roll for initiative. [audience cheers]"
283,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I got 21.
284,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Damn.
285,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, 18
286,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Wow.
287,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Plus...
288,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Wait, we get plusses?"
289,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, 3. 
290,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s two 21s.
291,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," OK, I rolled a 14 plus…"
292,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Plus 2. That’s a 16.
293,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Plus 16.
294,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," I’ve been sitting on the edge of my seat this entire time. I paid for the whole seat, but I only needed the edge."
295,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, My leather girdle doesn’t let me sit back. 
296,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, First up is actually the gold-faced snowman.
297,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [shocked, a little indignant] I rolled– I got 21."
298,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," I know, two of you did. The gold-faced snowman takes their ice spear and raises it up and throws it at Taako. Taako… that is a 18 versus AC."
299,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Try again. Disadvantage. Protection fighter.
300,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK. That’s a sssseven.
301,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, ...No.
302,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience and boys laugh],
303,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," This ice spear- the, the, the gold-face snowman throws it and it comes within an inch of you. It, it– [Travis hits Justin in the head with a prop shield as he tries to mime protecting him] You didn't have to hit him in the head with it as a, yeah."
304,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I just wanted him to know…
305,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," This ice spear travels the length of the room and comes just thiiiis close to hitting you, but it doesn’t. Next in the order is–"
306,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Do I bend, like the Matrix, or–"
307,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, it was totally sick."
308,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [indignantly] I did it!
309,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Taako, you’re actually up next."
310,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Oh, cool. Uh, I’m gonna melt ‘em, ‘cause fuck ‘em. Right? Uh, I’m gonna cast Wall of Fire. In a– on the two snowmen in a kind of line that would hit both of them."
311,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Here’s what happens.
312,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Uh oh.
313,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You conjure this wall of fire and as it starts to leave your hands, it seems like it hits the center of the room and it just stops and it activates almost like a force field, cutting a line across the center of the room, dividing you three and these two snowmen. And the spell just disappears as it hits this force field."
314,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Hmm, OK. Hold on, this is a force field that is…"
315,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Imagine a circle. Imagine the diameter of that circle.
316,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Now what if you could take that circle…
317,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, there’s just a line across the center of this circle and uh-"
318,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, And the spear went through it?
319,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
320,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I r– OK, is it my turn?"
321,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, actually."
322,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Alright.
323,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Unless, you know what? I’ll bump Taako back in the order, I’ll say because of your failed attack, you do get to go again so that you don’t get cheated out of your turn. "
324,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," OK, because I think it actually was my turn."
325,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, I’m going to cast… a different spell that I like very much… Ice Knife? As a third level spell?"
326,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Alright.
327,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, On… Are we fighting the birds too?
328,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, BIRDS?
329,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," The bird-men, obviously."
330,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] No. 
331,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] No[a][b][c][d], the birds left."
332,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] The [fighter birds?] are gone.
333,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, I’m gonna throw a 3rd level Ice Knife at one of the heads of the snowmen."
334,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, There’s gold-face snowman and carrot-face snowman.
335,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I’m gonna go for carrot top.
336,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK. Yeah, roll it. I assume you roll an attack on that one?"
337,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, That’s a… 4. It misses quite badly.
338,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, It misses so badly it hits the other one.
339,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, it does miss, but it does pass through that barrier."
340,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, OK.
341,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, you’re up next."
342,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna throw Chance Lance.
343,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK.
344,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, At gold face. My favorite Dick Tracy villain.
345,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Alright.
346,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," That’s an 18– oh, 16."
347,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Alright, you throw it and it hits that barrier in the center of the room and bounces off."
348,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Alright, I’m gonna try something else with my second attack."
349,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Think about what Taako just learned.
350,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I know, shut up."
351,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And really put it together.
352,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Alright, Chance Lance comes back."
353,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Follow the clues. You had all the clues you could have saved them. It’s literally a snowman reference.
354,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," What if I coat it in the snow? Like, dip it in the sn– like pack snow around it and throw it?"
355,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I want you to stop.
356,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Maybe I just–
357,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, No.
358,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Maybe I just stick it in the snow for a while and it gets real cold.
359,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, but really, stop."
360,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Stop it. Now really think about what you just said.
361,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I throw a snowball at Goldface.
362,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK.
363,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, That is a 12 plus my… 
364,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Whatever your regular attack modifier is.
365,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Plus 8. So it’s a 20.
366,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s a good hit on Goldface. Roll a d10 plus your attack modifier."
367,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [laughing] How does that work? “I kept it in the freezer all summer”. Uh, 9 plus my attack modifier, is plus 4, so 13. "
368,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, you hit him good. Uh, it knocks Goldface’s hat right off and takes a chunk of head out, too. And Goldface yells real loud at that."
369,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna dual wield with another snowball.
370,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, how does that work?"
371,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I have, I think, 8 attacks at a time I can do. And we’re trying to move this show along quickly. "
372,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
373,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," If you want to go out and use the toilet, this would be a good time to do it."
374,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," That’s another 12 plus 8, 20."
375,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah. That’s a hit. But you have to roll twice, right? On a dual wield. "
376,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Uh– no, this is just the second attack. So 6 plus 4, 10."
377,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. They are just barely hanging on to life. That one got their middle ball and now you can see some exposed skeleton bones. Ewww. Gross. 
378,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Grody.
379,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, You got any more attacks or are you out of attacks?
380,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I mean, I could."
381,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, The next in the order is Merle.
382,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Point of order if you knock Frosty’s hat off, he stops dancing around. So shouldn’t he be dead? [Audience Cheers] I could sing the song for you. “Frosty the Snowman–”"
383,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Stop, stop, no. Can’t."
384,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Right now, Griffin is looking at his watch to determine whether or not this fight has already taken long enough."
385,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No. Incorrect. But the gold-face snowman is like, almost down."
386,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," OK, I cast Sacred Flame at the–"
387,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Oh my–
388,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] OK, but you didn’t–"
389,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Throw snow.
390,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, stop, no, stop."
391,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, I cast Ice Shard.
392,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, You don’t have to say that in character voice. Go ahead.
393,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Unless you are in character, announcing that out loud."
394,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [laughs] OK, go ahead."
395,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Ice Shard.
396,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Thank you, thank you."
397,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, What’s that look like?
398,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," A big shard of ice, and it does 40 damage."
399,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, I just looked up Ice Shard in the book, but there’s no spell called Ice Shard."
400,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, You don’t even have a fucking card called Ice Shard!
401,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," I know that, Travis!"
402,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Are you cheating our brother at D&D?!
403,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Frost Bolt! I cast Frost Bolt at him. 
404,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s a fucking World of Warcraft spell! 
405,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I throw a freaking snowball.
406,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Awesome.
407,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Jeez. Alright, boom, there it goes. And it’s a freaking 6!"
408,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [quietly underneath Clint] Clerics have a 4th-level spell called Ice Storm.
409,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Ice Storm? That sounds really cool.
410,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Ice Storm, doesn’t it sound cool?"
411,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, But I get to roll–
412,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," WHAT DOES ICE STORM DO, JUSTIN?"
413,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," It wouldn’t help in this situation, Griffin, it only creates a hail of rock-hard ice pounding to the ground in a 20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder at a point within range."
414,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Now let’s assume–
415,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, That’s what I said!
416,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Let’s assume that in a different multiverse, our capable dad, Dad Two, cast that."
417,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Played by Tommy Lee Jones.
418,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, The DC version of our Marvel dad cast that. 
419,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Yeah. So I roll a d20 now?
420,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, no–"
421,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I cast Ice Storm on both of them.
422,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, let’s all take a beat. They have to make dexterity saving throws. Gold-faced one rolled a 6, that is not going to do it. Carrot-faced one rolls a… 14, which is not gonna beat your spell save throw modifier. So roll 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage. OR I’ll just do that for you."
423,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Wait, I got it. 4… 1… 3..."
424,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [doing math as Clint rolls] So that’s 5… I’m gonna say the gold-faced snowman goes down as they are bludgeoned by this snow. The carrot-faced snowman is also missing some chunks at this point.
425,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," That was very impressive, Merle. You’re very capable. "
426,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako, And you reacted so quickly. There was literally just a split second in between the action before and your action.
427,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, You truly are the most capable member of the team.
428,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Carrot s–
429,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Ho, ho, ho!"
430,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, OK.
431,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Carrot snowman throws their ice lance at Merle, trying to fight back against this hit. That’s a 22 versus AC."
432,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, No it’s not. Protection fighter.
433,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, that is a 19 versus AC. Merle."
434,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I thought he was protecting me.
435,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s a tie.
436,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It’s a tie.
437,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, It’s a tie!
438,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," I always forget, does that hit? [several audience members respond in unison “It hits”] Yeah, it’s a hit."
439,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [exasperated that this audience has betrayed him] Oh, thank you. Thank you."
440,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Ya hit him. A palpable hit.
441,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Oh my god, if you guys know the rules to D&D that well, this must be very frustrating for you. I’m just now realizing–"
442,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [keeps getting interrupted/crosstalk with his brothers] That is- That is-
443,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Did you guys just get really excited when we asked? Like “Thank you, it’s a hit. [exhales heavily] Oh god, I’ve just been sitting here–”"
444,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," That’s 20 points of ice damage as you are pierced by this ice lance. And as it hits you, the snowman pounds his hand down and another ice lance appears in his hand."
445,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," Hey, be careful, if you kill him, you’re Santa."
446,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience and Griffin laughing],
447,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Taako, you’re up next."
448,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Ah, good, so who do we have up still?"
449,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the carrot-faced snowman."
450,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," In the interest of moving things along, I’m going to throw a snowball."
451,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK.
452,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, At the carrot-faced snowman.
453,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Roll really good.
454,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," K, that is a 15."
455,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s a hit."
456,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, good."
457,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Roll a d10 plus your, uh... I guess your attack modifi- I don’t know what that is. Just do your spellcasting modifier. [crosstalk] It’s a magically delicious snowball."
458,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] I’m pretending it’s- yeah- That is a... 5 plus my spellcasting modifier of 5. So that’s a 10.
459,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s enough to take down the carrot-faced snowman.
460,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Hell yes.
461,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience cheers],
462,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{0,3508}
463,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Nice job, buddy."
464,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," As the last skeleton falls, the ice–"
465,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Who- who was that? Who said that to me?
466,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, That was-that was me.
467,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Did I hear that voice–
468,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] You’re my buddy! 
469,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] That was Dad, talking to you, Justin. "
470,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Ok, thank you. "
471,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Nice job, buddy!"
472,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Thank you, Dad, human dad, my dad, Justin McElroy’s dad, Clinton. "
473,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," As the last skeleton falls, the ice door you watched the three aarakocra pass through earlier slides open, granting you access deeper into the Icekeep."
474,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, We do that.
475,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You proceed down another frozen cobblestone tunnel, and as you go further, you hear another noise on top of the constant low crying that’s coming from the depths of the Icekeep. You actually hear another voice, only this one’s panicked and screaming–"
476,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [singing] I like to [starts laughing]
477,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[Clint laughing],
478,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [laughing] What? It’s screaming like it’s in pain, like I am, me, Griffin, right now. [audience laughter] And it’s screaming from the chamber just ahead of you. What do you do? "
479,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I rush in! 
480,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yup. Uh, you rush into the chamber at the end of the hall so fast that Justin’s hat falls off. And you find yourself–"
481,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Whose hat? 
482,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," It’s hard because if I put it on well enough, the people in the balcony don’t get what they paid for."
483,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It’s true. We’ll go hat– we’ll go hat-free for act two.
484,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience cheering],
485,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Wait, before you rush in, could I cast–"
486,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, That’s not how rush in works! 
487,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [somewhat dubiously/passive-aggressively] Oookay! 
488,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, What did you want to cast? 
489,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Were you going to cast something helpful?
490,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I cast Mass Healing Word on me and Taako. 
491,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Ok. You all are–
492,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Taako has not been hurt. 
493,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, but thank you, that puts a spring in my step and some vim in my vigor, being healed at maximum hit points. [Clint laughing] Mmm! Like drinking a frosty Coca-Cola, your healing spell washes over me and gives me the spring in my step!"
494,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You rush into the chamber at the end of the hall and you find yourself in a small stone carved room lit by braziers in each corner. Scattered around the floor are toys of enormous proportion, they are huge toys, and almost all of them have been smashed to pieces. You see the remnants of several clockwork soldiers that have been reduced to scraps by some vicious melee attacks. You see several large stuffed animals that have just been eviscerated, their cotton stuffing pouring out onto the floor. And you also see what looks like a, like a jack-in-the-box. It’s smaller than the other toys, it’s about one foot tall with a spring mounted figurine, uh, and that figurine actually looks like a woman wearing fencing gear. She’s holding a cutlass, and she’s bouncing frantically up and down because the box that she’s mounted in is aflame. And she seems distressed. "
495,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I put it out. 
496,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{37,45}
497,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Hooooooow? 
498,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, With my… 
499,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Breath? Hands? 
500,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Um… what do I have? 
501,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Just fuckin’ empty your f– You got a canteen you bring on your adventures.
502,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Yeah, is it so much I can’t pour a canteen on?"
503,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [high pitched, incredulous] No, it’s a small toy that’s on fire!"
504,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I put a– put a canteen on there!
505,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, You’re surrounded by snow! 
506,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, You dump your canteen out on this toy–
507,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Now he’s a problem solver! 
508,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [laughs] You dump your canteen out on this toy, and she breathes a sigh of relief, kind of–"
509,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Are you ok? 
510,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," She assesses the damage, uh, done to her, and she says, uh… what does she sound like? Uh…"
511,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [laughs] That’s a good question, Griffin, I think she’s sounds a little something like this!"
512,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Does she say [affected voice] “Nobody wants a Charlie-in-the-Box!” [audience cheers]
513,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, You’ll do a character voice for that! 
514,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{38,36}
515,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] I’m done. 
516,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] She says, um, she says,"
517,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jack-in-the-Box," [using a Southern accent] Thanks! I’m Bertha. Well, I’m a Bladed Bertha, that’s what my toy line’s called, [Magnus Yeah.] but I just go by Bertha for sheort– for short. What– sorry I said that so weird, I’m real nervous. What’s y’all’s handles? "
518,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," We don’t have handles, we’re human. "
519,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," You can call me Taako, or Taak for shuuuuurt. "
520,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, They call me Big Dog!
521,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," [in a drawn out, hearty accent] And I’m Santa Claus! "
522,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Hey, I’ve heard of you! "
523,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," She says, "
524,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Well, welcome to the chamber of misfit toys. Folks brought us– folks brought us from all around the world to try to appease the young master here, but it doesn’t look like he took to us, does it? "
525,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Nah, ‘cause you’re misfit toys– maybe they brought good toys! [audience groans] I mean, listen, I’m not being a jerk, I’m just saying!  "
526,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, She actually sinks back down into the box and the lid slams shut. 
527,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Listen, Bertha– can I call you Bertha? "
528,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, [muffled] No. 
529,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Bertha, I– I’m an idiot, and I–"
530,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," [in his Santa voice] Yes, he is! "
531,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Merle, could you not? "
532,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, [in his Santa voice] Who’s Merle? 
533,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Jesus Christ. 
534,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Who’s Je– oh, I know him. [Griffin laughing] "
535,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{39,55}
536,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] You do?
537,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Bitter– your, your–"
538,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, [crosstalk] Happy birthday! 
539,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Expanding the Santa lore pretty significantly right now!
540,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Your bitter enemy, Jesus! "
541,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Listen, I– Bertha. Bertha, please come back. "
542,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," She– the lid opens up, and she kind of reluctantly pops up. She says,"
543,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, That’s fine. Y’all are kinda mean. Are you here with those super mean ducks that came through here earlier? 
544,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," No, fuck a duck. "
545,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," They broke most of us, and set me on fire. I hope they get what’s coming to them!"
546,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Why would they do that?
547,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako, I have a feeling they will. 
548,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, she says, "
549,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Hey, y’all want–"
550,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," She starts bouncing up and down on her spring excitedly now,"
551,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Hey, y’all wanna duel real quick? "
552,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And then she, uh, [crosstalk] her–"
553,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, [crosstalk] Nooo. 
554,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," This light surrounds her and suddenly Taako, you’re holding a cutlass that matches the one that she has. It’s made of sturdy metal, but you can tell that the blade is pretty dull. After all, it’s a child’s toy. And as it appears in your hand, Bertha’s just bouncing around, flailing her cutlass, saying, "
555,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," En guarde, you bastard, have at you! "
556,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," So wait, it’s a child’s toy? "
557,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, it’s like a fun dueling toy. "
558,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," “Hey, fuck-o, c’mon!” Uh, ok, I make a melee attack, my first ever. 5. Is that good or bad for melee attacks? "
559,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, She knocks your attack out of the way and jabs you [crosstalk] in the tummy. 
560,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Fair enough. 
561,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] And you’re dead! 
562,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, no, it doesn’t do any damage, it’s a very blunt blade. She kinda laughs and sheathes her blade, and as she does yours disappears, and she says, "
563,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," So what brings y’all to Icekeep? If you’re here to kill the master, then unfortunately I gotta fight you."
564,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, No! We wanna make the master happy! Right now master is sad.
565,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, How’re you gonna do that? 
566,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," I don’t know. He’s Santa, he’s got toys or some shit. "
567,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," She says, uh, Bertha says, "
568,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," So, uh, you’re gonna give a present to the master? Whew! I’m glad I’m not in your shoes, he’s a tough–"
569,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, [crosstalk] Do you wanna come with us? 
570,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, He’s a tough nut to crack. 
571,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," He says– she says, uh, "
572,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," I’ll tell you what, yeah, why don’t you take me with you? I can maybe help you out. My master is a frost ogre, and his name’s Jimmy. "
573,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, What is it? 
574,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, Jimmy. 
575,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Jimmy? 
576,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, Jimmy. 
577,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Like, J-I-M-M-Y?"
578,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," That’s his Christian name, yeah. [crosstalk] Honestly–"
579,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] He’s a Christi–
580,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," [crosstalk] [Santa voice] Ah, we’re back to Christ again!"
581,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Just to double check, it’s a frost ogre? Jimmy the frost ogre? "
582,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Honestly, he’s really not that bad, he just– he doesn’t seem to care for toys, though, so keep that in mind if you’re trying to think of the right present. Though, if– if– so if I were you, I’d think, uh, re-think giving a ball and cup or a hula hoop or something. Anyway, you take me with you, maybe I can help keep Jimmy calm while you’re trying to figure out the perfect present. What do you say? "
583,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," And you’re a toy, right? "
584,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, I’m a very good toy. 
585,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Once again, uh, how about, uh, I’ll tell you what. We’ll– I’ll trade you your blunt cutlass for this rapier so you can actually help us in a fight."
586,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, Unfortunately this is the only one I can use.
587,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, She says–
588,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, [crosstalk] You have two hands–
589,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] And it’s probably soldered into her hand, too. "
590,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," [crosstalk] Yeah, unfortunately in this–"
591,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," [crosstalk] You have two hands, don’t you? "
592,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Yeah, but it doesn’t open, I’m a toy. [Griffin laughing] I’m not gonna– I’m not fuckin’ Sephiroth over here, I’m a toy, dude! "
593,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," All, right, well, come on, you come with me, and I–"
594,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, How big is it? 
595,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, like, just one foot tall, you can kind of–"
596,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I pick up the box–
597,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Yeah, come on. "
598,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok. Uh, so another ice door in front of you slides open, revealing a staircase leading upward to Jimmy’s chambers. And as you–"
599,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Jimbers!
600,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," The Jimbers. And as you ascend, that shrieking cry you’ve heard this whole time is almost unbearably loud and it’s rattling the walls with each wail. "
601,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] To be fair, the screaming from, from the room ahead of us–"
602,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," It’s not really screaming, [crosstalk] it’s like crying–"
603,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] No, no, but you said there was a screaming–"
604,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It was her on fire. 
605,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It was her on fire. Oh. 
606,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, she was upset about that. Um, the air is getting colder as you approach Jimmy’s chambers, blowing at you in squalls with each cry. And as you enter, you realise this chamber, Jimmy’s main hang zone, is a huge space–"
607,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Chill zone, please, Griffin, chill zone. "
608,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," His chill zone, uh, is magically eroded in the center of this glacier. Deep within the frozen walls of this room, you see enormous blue lights just swirling around in the ice, casting refractions of their light into the room. It’s a big empty space, about 200 feet long and 90 feet wide, and at the opposite end of the room you see Jimmy. "
609,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"He’s a massive blue ogre. He’s 25 feet tall at least, but despite his size, there’s something undeniably child-like about him. He’s wearing these bright green shorts and a red t-shirt that doesn’t entirely cover his belly, and that shirt is emblazoned with a Candlenights tree. And he’s just uncontrollably crying, and these big fat tears are dripping slowly off his face and each time one hits the floor, a ripple of light spreads out across the room, polishing the floor which you can recognise is just perfectly smooth, a shiny sheet of ice. And Jimmy doesn’t notice you entered, nor does he notice the other people in the room – the three aarakocra who are walking menacingly towards Jimmy, until they hear you enter, at which point they turn towards you. And the big armored one says, ",
610,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Armored Aarakocra," Heh, looks like they caught up with us after all. "
611,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"And the robed magic user one says, ",
612,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magic Aarakocra," Oh, what are we gonna do? We’re so close!"
613,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,"And the roguish looking one says, ",
614,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Rogue Aarakocra," What did I tell you, Ray? We’re gonna ice these clowns."
615,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’ll tell you what-
616,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Can we use fire stuff yet or...? [Griffin Yeah] OK, thank you."
617,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I also– what I want to do.
618,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Just say it. Just say something. Just say any–
619,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I want to take some of my metal thieves’ tools…
620,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [slightly wary of the situation] Okay…
621,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And using some various bits of rope, strap them to the bottoms of my shoes. Make some ice skatessssssss. [audience cheers]"
622,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, so the bad guys look at us, right? And then we’re like “Guys, quick! Something, we gotta think of it!” And Magnus, like, “Hold on.”"
623,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Gotta lace up!
624,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Gotta lace up my magic skates.
625,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Quack.
626,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, As you do–
627,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, QUACK. QUACK.
628,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, As you do that… 
629,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, They kill you.
630,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[Griffin and Clint laugh],
631,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Bladed Bertha begins to glow as she sees what you’re doing, Magnus, and you f- you see her start to glow again. And Taako and Merle, around your boots, something’s happening. You realize that two cutlasses have appeared on the bottoms of your shoes, also giving you skates. For ice. And the three of you stand up, and before, when you walked into this room you were losing your footing, but now you’re- you’re graceful as swans. And you see the three aarakocra, you can now see their legs as they’re sort of moving towards you, and they have these webbed duck feet as they are coming closer and closer towards you, but they see that now you’re standing, that you’ve cancelled out their evolutionary advantage, standing on your iced skates. And the big aarakocra, still charging at you, says"
632,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Armored Aarakocra, What is this witchcraft?
633,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And I point at him and say
634,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, I’m gonna duck you up.
635,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s good enough. We’re going to take intermission right there. We’ll be right back [audience cheers and the jingling sleigh bells from the Poem Background Music play as we transition into the ad block]"
636,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{Ad block, 04712-05112}
637,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Alright, I’m going to use your initiative rolls from the last battle. Which means Taako, you’re going first. Just to set the stage you all are in literally a big hockey rink or ice skating rink. Essentially, depending on whether you want to go more of a Mighty Ducks or a Yuri!!! on Ice route with this fight. [audience cheers loudly] I will support–"
638,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I love that– Listen, can I tell you why I love this crowd? Mighty Ducks? Silenceeee. Yuri!!! on Ice? YEAAAAAAAAH! I’ve never seen a clearer separation of “no, not that, YES THAT!”."
639,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," So Taako, you’re going first. You are all on ice skates and the three aarakocra are on ice skates. One of them is big and armored, one of them’s sort of roguish with two daggers, and one of them is a smaller spellcaster. And they are fighting you. In a fight."
640,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Hehe. Um, OK, uh–"
641,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, where’d that hair come from?"
642,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," I took off my hat, this is the hair that’s underneath it."
643,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s just what Justin looks like.
644,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Just- just le it back a little bit, because you do your acting with your eyes. Son."
645,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," That’s a good point. [audience cheers] Fucking, Justin’s on some Harry Styles shit."
646,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Um– okay-
647,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Who?
648,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Just ‘cause I’ll never get another opportunity to do anything this amazing again, uh,"
649,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," [not in character voice, but probably in character] Hey, Bertha."
650,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha," Uh, yeah?"
651,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako, Can you make four more blades? [audience loses their minds]
652,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Bertha, I can– I can make as many blades as ya need.
653,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako, That’s the right answer. 
654,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I cast Phantom Steed.
655,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [laughingly] Wait, so you guys know about this?"
656,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Your- you extend your staff and Garyl springs forward–
657,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, you’re assuming, maybe it’s a different steed."
658,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Nonono, there’s my steed. It’s Garyl."
659,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Garyl springs forth from your staff, and for a moment he lands on the ice and his legs just go all over. And he’s just like,"
660,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Garyl," Yo, why did you bring me here?"
661,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And then Bertha glows and suddenly… Garyl’s wearing four ice skates, and is still a little bit- still a horse. So still a little bit like,"
662,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Garyl, Not much better
663,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [cross talk] Wait, technically"
664,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, I know how to fix this."
665,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Garyl, I think you’re cute."
666,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Thinks they’re cute, then they can fly."
667,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And he’s a binicorn. I mean, I don’t want to– he’s not a horse, he’s a binicorn."
668,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Actually, the light forms around Merle’s Santa suit again, and it actually hits Garyl, and now suddenly, Garyl’s fur is this dark brown. His long tail extends to sort of a bushy ball, and his two horns are now glowing bright red."
669,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," And I say,"
670,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Garyl with your horns so bright, won’t you bite this fight tonight?"
671,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, OK. When I-
672,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Now, to be fair, he did say “bite this fight”."
673,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," When I cast- when I cast it, I cast it in the direction of them and hopped on, so I was hoping to just kind of tumble–"
674,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Charge them? Yeah, sure."
675,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Sort of tumble into ‘em.
676,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Sure, roll a d20 plus your spellcasting."
677,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, That’s a 19.
678,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, that’s definitely going to hit, not the armored one- actually that might hit any of them. Who do you want to hit with Charging Garyl?"
679,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Uh…
680,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," The armored one, the rogue, or the spellcaster?"
681,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, The spellcaster.
682,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[Clint and Travis agree],
683,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, yeah. Uh, yeah, that is a hit, go ahead and roll, eeeeh, we’ll say 2d10. Plus your spellcasting modifier. Oh, he found his dice. Finally. [Justin Thank you] They were on the drink cart."
684,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yeah, I do. Uh, that’s a 7, plus 3, so 10."
685,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, 10 plus your spellcasting modifier.
686,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, 15.
687,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You’re 15? OK, you uh, pierce into Ray, the magic-wielding duck. And he gets knocked up into the air–"
688,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, He gets knocked up? [Griffin laughing]
689,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, That’s a potent spell!
690,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Finally, my Tumblr fanfiction is coming to fruition."
691,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And then Taako said “Hey, duck. What’s up duck?”"
692,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Uh, gets knocked up into the air. And as it gets knocked up into the air, two beams shoot out of Garyl’s horns and blast it also in the air for another 9 points of damage [Justin Whoa] as these two heat rays shoot out of Garyl’s bright red horns."
693,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And Garyl says,"
694,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Garyl," “Ho ho ho, now I have two horns”"
695,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Because Die Hard?
696,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Everyone gets one of those, yes. OK, n–"
697,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Still not a Christmas movie, but it’s fun."
698,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Oh, we can’t fucking do this on a stage in front of–"
699,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, It is a Christmas movie!
700,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Hey, fuck you. It’s not a Christmas movie... Is Batman Returns a Christmas movie? "
701,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [sings about how they can’t do this on stage]
702,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Griffin please, just 30 seconds, just 30 seconds, OK? It’s- OK. It’s, OK, it’s–"
703,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Go ahead.
704,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," If you’re not timing it, then it’s [stutters] it’s not a Christmas movie. It’s set at Christmas, but it’s not a Christmas– Like, lots of movies– [someone in the audience yells ”It’s a Christmas movie!”] No, it’s not. It’s not thematically related to Christmas, it’s just set at Christmas-"
705,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It could happen on Arbor Day–
706,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And Christmas is not thematically related… OK, good."
707,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Time. Time. End of discussion. Next in the order–
708,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Is Nightmare Before Christmas a Christmas movie?
709,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Yes!
710,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
711,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Fucking… come on. Magnus you’re up-
712,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And it’s also a Halloween movie.
713,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, OK. Wow.
714,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [with an infinite amount of patience] That was the last diversion.
715,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna charge the cake-eater.
716,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, There’s a curse.
717,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’mma charge. The cake-eater.
718,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I don’t know what that means.
719,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," The cake-eater, it’s the big beefy one. You told me I could make Mighty Ducks references. [audience cheers] "
720,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," OK, then you would say “I’m gonna charge the bash brother”, because he is the one–"
721,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Nonononono.
722,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Cake-eater was the handsome boy. He was the Matchbox–
723,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, no, no–"
724,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I literally said that was the last divergence. And that–
725,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, But that doesn’t make it true!
726,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Cake-eater was the Matchbox 20 lookin’ motherfucker. It wasn’t the big burly one.
727,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," He was NINE, who’d he look like? Was there a nine year old in Matchbox 20?"
728,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, It was Joshua Jackson who looks like Rob Thomas.
729,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, Joshua Jackson was the main one who was the leader of the–"
730,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," A black fog- A black fog spreads throughout the ice rink, and it’s a curse! And the curse is this “the next time you aaaaaall get off-topic while playing Dungeons and Dragons, your character will befall a terrible fate. I’m- [audience laughs] I’m not joking.”"
731,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," OK, with an unarmed charge– no, no, no, Phantom Fist charge, Phantom Fist charge– [someone in the audience says something indistinguishable] Hell yes, [Clint Hell yeah!] audience member. I rolled a 15 plus uh, 8."
732,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yes, that’s a hit on the armored duck."
733,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," OK, that’s 1d4–"
734,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, You’re just punching him?
735,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Yeah, well, with a push."
736,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, so you’re checking them, to use–"
737,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Well it’s only 1, so that’s 5 points of damage."
738,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Great.
739,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Ho ho ho, I have two attacks."
740,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK, so that’s Travis’."
741,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Thank you. Then I’m gonna throw Chance Lance at them as they stumble back.
742,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK.
743,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," That’s a 16 plus 8, 24."
744,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s definitely a hit.
745,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Oh, excuse me, [Griffin It’s a hit] it’s a 25"
746,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Oh, that’s a Super Hit."
747,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, So it’s a [Street Fighter voice] HIIIIIIT. {05858}
748,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
749,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And that’s 1d10… That’s a one. PLUS, plus 5. Six."
750,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, OK. 
751,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, So that’s 11 and then–
752,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Both Ray and the armored duck are looking kinda not great.
753,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And I’m going to use my Action Surge to attack again.
754,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, With what?
755,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Uh, the Raging Flaming Poisoning Sword of Doom."
756,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, You want to tell your story now?
757,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I do. So, I have a really, really incredibly beautiful hand-ma–"
758,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, We don’t have it yet.
759,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, here’s the thing…"
760,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Please do not expect Travis just to lift it up from under the table.
761,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, No. A shipping company who shall remain nameless failed to get– I said [mumbles] it’ll remain nameless.
762,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, But it’s not Fed-Ex and it’s not America.
763,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, But it’s not Fed-Ex and it’s not the United States Postal Service– fucked up real bad so it’s not here. BUT I wa–
764,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," If you live in Kentucky, know that the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom is nearby!"
765,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk]
766,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," It’s treasure, hidden in a UPS dungeon–"
767,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, But I knew I– YOU SAID THE NAME.
768,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, “Shall remain!”
769,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, They fucking know who it is.
770,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, that’s short for Upsy. I want to give a big shout-out to Lauren and Grant, who fucking worked their asses off to try to get it here, including flying from LA to Seattle to try to physically go to the place and bring it, only to find out it wasn’t there."
771,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Grant of Mythbusters fame, also of “being a super solid dude” fame."
772,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Yeah, Grant Imahara? Apparently, the best."
773,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, The best.
774,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Thank you to both of you.
775,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," But also Lauren, Lauren who made the sword is the best. And then I’m going to attack with the Raging Flaming Poisoning Sword of Doom. Well that’s a 5, BUT, plus a nine."
776,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s a hit. I’ve decided.
777,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Hey, thanks."
778,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, On the armored duck?
779,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
780,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Are you sure? [out of the side of his mouth] Oooh, ya sure that’s who it’s attacking? Because that might not hit the armored duck."
781,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna hit the rogue one.
782,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Eyyy, it’s a hit!"
783,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And I believe that’s this plus a bunch? I don’t have that one. That’s a 6, plus 5, 11, plus like what, 42?"
784,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Audience Member, 20!
785,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It’s plus 20.
786,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Thank you, commissioner."
787,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, So that’ll be 31.
788,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," OK. So the armored duck– er, the rogue duck is now looking very bad."
789,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," And I’m going to, because I have an extra attack, I’ll use my other attack– "
790,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Good god.
791,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I only get to do this!
792,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Yeah, but you do it over and over and over."
793,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I don’t do anything. I rolled a 1. That was a 1. I think about attacking, but then I remember a time someone made fun of me when I was a child."
794,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Is there any flavor to your attacks, or are you just sort of on ice skates, flailing a big sword around?"
795,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Griffin–
796,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I want that flavor.
797,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I am skating like a– I don’t know, what’s a really good skating animal?"
798,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Alright, we’re moving on."
799,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," A penguin! Like a penguin! Like a Snoopy. I’m skating like a– That’s the thing, you look at me and go “oh, he’s a great– Oh, he sliced that guy”. But you don’t see the attack coming, because surprisingly–"
800,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, So lovely.
801,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Magnus is fucking graceful on the ice.
802,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure. Uh, next–"
803,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, LIKE… [quietly] no.
804,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Next in the order is Ray, the magic duck who’s not looking very good."
805,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, What a weird sentence.
806,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ray the magic duck– uh, uh, they-"
807,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Beloved Christmas character.
808,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Lifts their staff into the air and casts Haste on the rogue. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 to AC, and it has advantage on dexterity saving throw, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. So you see this light surround the leather armor-clad duck with the two knives, and suddenly they are skating like a bullet. Aaaall around the rink, doing laps and beautiful jumps, pirouettes, axels… [Griffin runs out of ice skating words to throw in here as he trips over an “l” sound a few times] "
809,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Stuff.
810,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No no no, let him keep going."
811,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, A toe loop. [audience cheers]
812,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, You’re not leaving anything else for the rest of us.
813,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, uh, and they are actually up next. And they are going to come after… Let’s see, who attacked the rogue duck? It was Magnus. Yeah. OK, they are going to come at you and they are going to take two attacks with these big, gnarly knives. One is a [high pitched] critical hit. "
814,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Oh?
815,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And one is a 17 versus AC?
816,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, what is it?"
817,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Seventeen.
818,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Yeah, that was a miss. [one audience member yells “Yeah”] Yeaaaaah."
819,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Critical hits going to be–
820,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I know, I was checking– Hold on, I was checking my list of things I could do. I’m not just like, on Twitter. “Hey guys, so, playing D&D. What are you guys doing?”"
821,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, The crit is 36 points of damage.
822,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, it critted on me?"
823,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yes. Uh, next in the order iiiiiis… Merle. Santa."
824,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Ahhhh. Alright.
825,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Are there any truths that they possess [Griffin laughs] that we need to extract from them?
826,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Merle does a Hamill Camel. 
827,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, What’s that? 
828,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," That’s something Dorothy Hamill used to do. I-I don’t know, she spun around and carried water on her back. I don’t know exactly what it was."
829,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] Sure.
830,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," And, stay with me, give me a second, give me–"
831,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Oh fuck.
832,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] God damn That’s the most ominous like, scary thing."
833,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, That’s very ominous. Careful of the black fog.
834,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," He casts Planar Ally. And summons– wait, wait– and summons Gundren with the Phoenix Fire Gauntlet. [A cacophony from the audience, some people cheering, some people shouting incredulously]"
835,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Right now, people at home, the silence you hear is me, Justin, and Griffin wondering if it’s either a “fuck you” or a “that’s the most competent thing our father… has ever done… in his whole life”."
836,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, OK.
837,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Alright, here’s what I-"
838,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Cause I obviously failed as a parent.
839,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, no-"
840,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Well, yeah."
841,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yikes.
842,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Your sons play D&D for a living, get your shit together, dad."
843,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Alright, it’s definitely-"
844,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Here’s what we do-
845,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, It’s definitely the first one because he’s dead [crosstalk] and we took the gauntlet from him...
846,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] No no no no no, here’s what I’ll do with this."
847,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Ok
848,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," But I’ll need a- I’ll need a roll, and now we’re just playing fucking Calvinball folks."
849,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Because we’re on a time limit.
850,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Not yet, not yet, not yet! ‘Cause I wanna explain what it is, what I’m envisioning for this scene."
851,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Ok.
852,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] Interior day.
853,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Smash cut!
854,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," I think you cast this spell and you specifically pull him from the moment of Old Phandalin’s destruction for, for, like, a tenth of a second. For like a tenth of a second, you just see this flash and suddenly in front of you, the smooth ice that you’re on turns to that smooth black glass of Phandalin. And it’s just like, it’s just like [snaps] that quick, but there is fire fucking everywhere in that second, and you catch the three birds in the flame. But I wanna- like, the strength of the projection is going to be based on your D20 roll plus spellcasting modifier and if it’s shitty… we’ll figure it out. [audience laughs]"
855,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Well, if it’s shitty, I’ll just lie."
856,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, you won’t."
857,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," By the way, folks, this scene is a, can be seen in the forthcoming graphic novel [crosstalk] from First Second."
858,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Spoiler alert. Yeah, go to theadventurezonecomic.com and get our graphic novel, it’s-"
859,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Theadventurezonecomic.com, roll that shit!"
860,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Here we go.
861,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Not bad, not bad. Fourteen?"
862,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [exasperated] What did he say, four?"
863,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Fourteen.
864,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Teen, teen! Plus my… spellcasting modifier."
865,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Well, plus 5."
866,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Mine is 5, you can borrow it."
867,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, 19.
868,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, 19!
869,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Uhhhh yeah. That’s a number. And now-
870,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," No, wait a minute-"
871,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s actually plus 8.
872,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Plus 8. So, it’s 22. [audience cheers]"
873,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, So fuck off!
874,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clints, Ducks!
875,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok, with a 22 you-"
876,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, hold on, hold on..."
877,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Oh I don’t like that.
878,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, say it, say it, say it. [someone in audience calls ‘say it’ as well]"
879,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Now I have 22 attacks, ho ho ho."
880,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok, now everyone’s used them up and we’re done!"
881,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," What was that, by the way, what was that from?"
882,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, It’s from Die Hard.
883,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] From fucking Die Hard! Uh oh, the black fog, be careful. Ok so- [Justin laughs] the rogue duck with the haste speeds dodges out of the way of the column of fire, but the armored duck and magic duck are both caught up in it. With that, the magic duck is incinerated [Justin Oh shit!] in a flash and is gone."
884,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Crispy Duck!
885,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [laughs but continues] The armored duck is looking-
886,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Hold on-
887,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] No, it was good, it was good."
888,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Wait a minute, crispy duck! "
889,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, That was really good. [audience cheers]
890,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," The armored duck is looking like a stiff wind could probably knock them over and the rogue duck, who is still kinda bad off, got out of the way so it’s just the two of them. [someone blows into a their mic] And then, just as quickly as that, they’re gone. And another teardrop falls out of the ogre’s eye and as it hits the ground, the ice that was sort of melted by the fire is zambonied back into shape. Taa-ko..."
891,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Um, ok, I-"
892,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You’re still on Garyl, your beautiful steed."
893,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," I’m on Garyl my beautiful steed and I race towards them, and I raise the Umbrastaff and I say"
894,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Taako," Bad news, idiots! I know how the podcast ends and we can’t die."
895,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin,  And I cast-
896,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Just to set it up, the poem did establish that this takes place after everything else that’s happened in the podcast."
897,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Oh really? It takes place after- spoiler alert-
898,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," No, wait, don’t do it ‘cause-"
899,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [laughs loudly] Ok, no, Travis- Justin’s right, ok, I take it back."
900,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I cast Delayed Blast Fireball.
901,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [total confusion] What?
902,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, We alls fucked now. [everyone laughs] A beam of yellow light flashes from my hand and I-
903,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m glad you said hand.
904,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yeah. The bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the explosion of flame must make a dexterity saving throw. If you don’t save, it goes bad. And you’re gonna- we’ll see, we’ll just do the dexterity saving throw now."
905,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok. So, the hastened rogue duck has advantage on dexterity saving throws."
906,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I just wanna confirm though that we’re far enough away from Jimmy that this is not going to-
907,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, Jimmy is still very, very far away."
908,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Thank you.
909,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," The magic duck rolled a five… Oh, the magic duck’s dead, the armored duck rolled a five. And the rogue duck, critical miss, and a 21 versus AC, or whatever the-"
910,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," It’s a dexterity saving throw, so-"
911,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, It’s against your spellcasting save.
912,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Which is 18. You guys should roll, too."
913,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s a 4.
914,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Merle, roll that d20. You are saving the-"
915,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I need to start rolling my d6 now ‘cause if I don’t start now I won’t be done.
916,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Here, we’ll do this, we’ll just roll the d6 once and multiply by the number of dice."
917,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Well, that’s not how numbers work."
918,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," [exasperated] Ok, then start rolling it."
919,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Don’t you have a computer program that can roll?
920,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
921,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Ok, it’s 12d6. [audience freaks out]"
922,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I… I’m gonna use parry. [Justin dies laughing]
923,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Which one of the ducks is that?
924,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I think since we’re so good on our skates we should get advantage on that roll, Griffin."
925,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok, no! Uh, Merle, what-"
926,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, You did say ok first.
927,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Merle, what did you get?"
928,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, I rolled a 19.
929,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Hell yeah, dude!"
930,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok, Merle saves. Uh, you see Merle leaping gracefully from the explosion as both of the armored folks are caught up and hit for 36 points of fire damage."
931,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Oh, no, I’m fine. "
932,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Ok. That is enough to also incinerate the armored duck, leaving just the rogue duck."
933,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," I’m down to 41, I’m doing fine. 41, that’s still better than most of you have."
934,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yeah!
935,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Oh wait, hold on, I should roll mine. Yeah, it’s fine."
936,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, You don’t hit yourself.
937,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," I don’t think I’d hit myself, would I? No, probably not. Doesn’t make sense."
938,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, I mean you’re aiming it- yeah, yeah, I’ll give it to you."
939,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Aiming it exactly 21 feet away? For sure. For sure, for sure, for sure."
940,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," And you’ve got that spell shaping thing too, right?"
941,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Absolutely, thank you, Clinton. Yes, spell shaping, so important."
942,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Next up is the- rogue-
943,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Is me.
944,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [in dread] ...It is. Uh oh. You’re gonna hurt ‘em. {{11248}}
945,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I’m going to aim Chance Lance at the rogue.
946,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] They’re going very fast. Ok.
947,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And then I’m going to aim about two feet in front of them.
948,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Alright. Take advantage on that because you’re leading your target.
949,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Yeah, ok. That was a 23."
950,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yup, that’ll do it."
951,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Duck Hunt, baby."
952,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Roll your damage.
953,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s an 8 plus 5. 13.
954,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Here’s the scene that rogue duck jumps out of the way of Taako’s explosion and then turns on its heels and does that cool thing where the ice shoots up, and then just started using its haste to sprint towards Jimmy. And as it was going, you calculated using, let me see, the fucking [Travis No, I guessed] arithmetic fall and spread out of Magnus’ brain and you throw the lance and- oh wait, now we have another great line. {{11331}}"
955,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, Take a gander at that!
956,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [chuckling] Okay.
957,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience cheers],
958,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," We’re even, right?"
959,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, you’re even. The duck was very, very far away as you threw Chance Lance at it."
960,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And I mumbled that line. [mutters under his breath]
961,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And you just kind of see it far away, its tiny form just kind of [plop sound effect] fall over dead. And you have solved my duck puzzle."
962,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Yeah! [audience cheers]
963,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And with that, as the last of the aarakocra go down, finally Jimmy in the back of the room sees all the combat from afar, and he seems really upset that there’s all this fighting happening in his bedroom, essentially, and tears are just streaming off his face, sending these constant ripples across the surface of the ice. And the wailing is so loud now that the room is shaking and above you, you hear the ice start to crack in these deep booms. "
964,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s gonna be ok.
965,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," You don’t have long to- please don’t fucking disarm the drama and tension of the situation. Jimmy sees the three of you skate towards him with Bertha bouncing as Magnus, I guess, has it strapped to your back, fucking-"
966,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, It’s on my shoulder like a parrot.
967,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Yoda style.
968,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [affronted] No.
969,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And Jimmy looks down and looks at the three of you and Jimmy says,"
970,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," [deep, sad voice] Santa? Is that-"
971,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, My pebbles! [audience laughs]
972,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy, Is that really you?
973,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," [deep Santa voice] Hello, Jimmy."
974,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," Santa, why haven’t you-"
975,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [impersonating Clint’s Santa voice] I’m Johnny Cash! 
976,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,{1,1522}
977,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [Johnny Cash voice] Hello, Jimmy."
978,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, He says-
979,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [sings] Love is a burning thing. [audience cheers]
980,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, That was really good.
981,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Thank you.
982,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, Jimmy says
983,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy, Why haven’t you visited me? I’ve been a really good boy.
984,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,[audience aws],
985,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Santa casts Zone of Truth. [audience cheers]
986,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Have you been a good boy? Let’s find out.
987,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," That’s a 12. Everybody else roll too, we’re doing this fucking thing."
988,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, That’s a 3. Ok.
989,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Yes Jimmy, I am Santa Claus."
990,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, That wasn’t the question. [Griffin laughs loudly] The question-
991,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," Yes, it was!"
992,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, the question is “why didn’t you bring me anything?” You’re just like “yeah, I’m Santa.”"
993,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," [crosstalk] Why didn’t you bring me any presents, Santa?"
994,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Well Jimmy, I tried to get in, but your fucking door was locked [Griffin laughs, audience cheers] and you don’t have a chimney."
995,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," It’s true, I live in an iceberg. I thought that was it. "
996,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," No, Jimmy, Santa has always loved you. Now-"
997,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Wait, hold on, you’re in Zone of Truth. Santa did say in his list that he was afraid of this place."
998,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," [still using Santa voice] But you can love things and be afraid of them, son. [audience cheers]"
999,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, What does that even mean?
1000,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, I know what it means. [Griffin laughs]
1001,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Jimmy says,"
1002,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," Well, did you bring me a present?"
1003,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Well Jimmy, I can give you a present, but I need to know what would make you happier than anything in the whole-"
1004,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," I’m a little kid, I don’t know. I’m just-"
1005,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Fuck off
1006,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," I don’t know what- I don’t know. I haven’t been happy in awhile, I’m just so lonely down here."
1007,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [realization] Oh.
1008,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," Jimmy, maybe true happiness lies within. Maybe- go with me here, go with me. Jimmy, maybe true happiness is not something you find wrapped up in a gift."
1009,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Fuck that, come here."
1010,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Ok.
1011,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy, [cries] Why’re you taking so long?
1012,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle, I can give you anything. How would you like… a friend?
1013,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy, A real friend?
1014,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Merle," A real friend. A little boy, just like you."
1015,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," And I open the bag [Griffin laughs loudly] and a little hand reaches out with a magnifying glass in it. [audience cheers] And he says, “Happy Hanukkah, sirs!” [more audience cheering]"
1016,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Angus McDonald appears from the bag, I guess, and immediately starts slipping on the ice, immediately starts shivering, extremely cold. He’s in his pajamas-"
1017,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Hold on, hold on, hold on."
1018,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And he says
1019,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Angus," [distressed and confused] What’s going on? Where am I? I’m so cold, everything's cold."
1020,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, I give him the feathered cuirass and say
1021,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus," Suck it up. Get your shit together, kid."
1022,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And Jimmy looks at Angus and says
1023,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy, Hello. Do you want to be my friend?
1024,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And Angus looks around the room at the fact that he’s in the middle of a glacier, in the middle of a dungeon, and sees you three with battle wounds, and three dead ducks on the floor, and the 25 foot ogre standing in front of him. And we see the arithmetic form around Angus’s brain as he says, "
1025,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Angus, [hesitant] Yes.
1026,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," If I may, can Magnus lean in and whisper to Angus?"
1027,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I guess.
1028,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, [whispered] Pen pals. Pen pals!
1029,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Angus," Excuse me, new friend, do you own a pen?"
1030,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, And Jimmy says
1031,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Jimmy," No, I don’t."
1032,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Magnus, There’s plenty of feathers and quills around.
1033,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And sure enough, Jimmy reaches down and plucks one of the feathers off of the dead duck in front of him."
1034,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, He dips it in their blood. [Clint laughs]
1035,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," And you see Jimmy and Angus talking, and Jimmy realizes-"
1036,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," What’s your AOL, AIM?"
1037,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," They trade screen — uh, usernames, and with this, Jimmy stops crying and he cheers. And as he cheers, the iceberg around you just explodes and the ice goes flying outwards, and suddenly all of you are standing out in the snow fields in the hills beyond Phandalin again. And as you are standing there, you realize that the raging snow storm has finally eased up. The clouds above have thinned, letting strands of bright moonlight pierce through, illuminating the slow, fluffy flakes floating lazily through the air [Clint starts to gently sing “Welcome Christmas”] with soft and lovely light. Over the hills, you can hear cheering as folks celebrate the quieting of the cry from the Icekeep and then, in the quiet of this gentle snow, you can hear those cheering voices start singing carols as they realize."
1038,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint," We don’t rehearse this stuff, folks!"
1039,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, we just all happen to share the same brain."
1040,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
1041,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, We have one quarter of it each.
1042,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Believe it or not, we don’t rehearse. As hard as that must be for you to believe in this exact moment."
1043,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, The people of Phandalin are singing carols as they realize in unison that Candlenights is saved.
1044,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, And it didn’t come in boxes...
1045,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, I actually have a poem to walk us out.
1046,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Wait, before we read the poem should we say thank you to everybody?"
1047,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," We can do it after the poem, too."
1048,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," It’s up to you, it’s your rodeo."
1049,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Nah, let’s do it now."
1050,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Thank you, everybody, for coming-"
1051,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Yes, thank you Tacoma and Seattle, by extension ‘cause I know a lot of you came up."
1052,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, you know what? Fuck Seattle."
1053,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," No, stop, we’re gonna be there all weekend- we will be there all weekend, Travis does not mean-"
1054,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Fuck Seattle!
1055,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] This is just for Tacoma!
1056,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Thank you to the Pantages, this place is absolutely beautiful-"
1057,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," No, you know what?"
1058,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] No! Stop.
1059,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, [laughing] Fuck this place.
1060,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Thank you to Sam for helping us out, thanks to CAA for helping us get this show together and-"
1061,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis, Thank you to Somerset Sews for building ⅔ of the costumes.
1062,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, And the Cut/Sew for my costume.
1063,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Thank you to Lauren and Grant. The sword didn’t make it, but Lauren is posting pictures of the sword to their Twitter."
1064,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Oh! Come to Podcon if you want tomorrow, if you don’t have tickets-"
1065,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Podcon.com, you can get in-person tickets still or do remote attendance if you can’t make it down. Podcon.com."
1066,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, they’re streaming it."
1067,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, They’re literally here. 
1068,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Travis," Yeah, but they’re 45 minutes away. I don’t wanna drive 45 minutes."
1069,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Fair enough.
1070,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin," We’re gonna be doing a The The Adventure Zone Zone where we’re gonna be talking about stuff, and a live MBMBaM and some other panels we’re all on."
1071,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," And sincerely, thank you so much.  You guys are so fun."
1072,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, This is always the most fun shit ever.
1073,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin, Y’all are grand.
1074,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin, But I do have a poooooem.
1075,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Justin," Ok, read your poem."
1076,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Clint, Poooooem.
1077,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,Griffin,
1078,Candlenights in Tacoma Live Show,“And so did the wailing from down in Icekeep,
