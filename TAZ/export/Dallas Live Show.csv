7,Dallas Live Show,[THEME MUSIC, “Déjà Vu” by Mort Garson (full song on YouTube)]
8,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I’m wearing a sweater from J Crew. [audience cheers] Alright, alright."
9,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And now I have to shed a bunch of pieces so I can operate as a human being.
10,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Let’s go behind the music a little bit, let’s say there’s some pieces of Travis’s sort of tunic-girdle situation that maybe, the armor— "
11,Dallas Live Show,Travis, He’s had some offtime.
12,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, He’s had some offtime(!)
13,Dallas Live Show,Travis," There was another piece that went about my waist, or attempted to. [audience laughter] Listen, hard-living, you know what I mean? I beat the Hunger and then I experienced the hunger."
14,Dallas Live Show,Justin," “I saw seven birds” oh hell yeah, fried, roasted, what’s up? Fucking eat those for sure. Where are these seven birds? Why are you holding out on me? I’m starving!"
15,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Hi everybody, welcome to The Adventure Zone live in Dallas! [audience cheers] Sorry about the “yee-haw” thing in the intro, I sat backstage for like thirty minutes and couldn’t think of anything else to say."
16,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Hey, it’s us!"
17,Dallas Live Show,Justin," I was backstage, it was about three."
18,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I get nervous, I need to dial in. Speaking [elongating the f] of… Do we want to talk about what Dad did today, or save that for MBMBaM?"
19,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Save it for tomorrow. I’ve seen the numbers and I know some of y’all aren’t coming tomorrow so buy your tickets, you’re going to get a great vignette about our dad."
20,Dallas Live Show,Clint, It’s bad.
21,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You’re right, we should get into it because we got a lot to do today and we always run out of time. Do we have a timer?"
22,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [repeatedly, in an odd accent] Paul?"
23,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [elongated] Pauuuuuuul?
24,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Paul! Ladies and gentleman! [presumably Paul has brought/shown the McElroys a timer]
25,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
26,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Thank you, Paul!"
27,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Go to paulandstorm.gov to hear some of their tracks!
28,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, That they make.
29,Dallas Live Show,Justin, That they make. Paul and his imaginary friend Storm.
30,Dallas Live Show,[Griffin laughs],
31,Dallas Live Show,Justin, He swears he’s real.
32,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Uh— 
33,Dallas Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Wait wait wait, before we get started— "
34,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [noises of surprise and disbelief]
35,Dallas Live Show,Clint," I’d like everybody to look at the back of the theatre, everybody look at the back of the theatre."
36,Dallas Live Show,Justin, These are the emergency exits [inaudible]
37,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Okay, you can look back up here now. [Griffin laughs]"
38,Dallas Live Show,Clint, That’s where Bobby sits. Hey Bobby!
39,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Hey Bobby.
40,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Hey! {{258}}
41,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [stuttering] Hi Bobby, Bobby’s running the sound board up there, Bobby came to us before the show and said, “So what are y’all gonna be discussing tonight?” and I was like, “Well Bobby, that’s a very hard question to answer my friend, hold on a second.”"
42,Dallas Live Show,Clint," And he said, “Well give me a shout-out, that way I can wake up.”"
43,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Can we get house lights for a second so we can see the good good cosplay that’s happening?
44,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Yeah, house lights, could we get house lights for a second?"
45,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," If you are— oh there’s Bobby with the strobe, thank you Bobby."
46,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Bobby’s got a strobe.
47,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Can we get house lights? Is there a switch or, is there a dial that says maybe “HL” on it, short for house lights? No, okay, then we can’t get house lights, we’ll do that after intermission! Let’s get into the adventure, here we go."
48,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah!
49,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
50,Dallas Live Show,Travis," But, but Paul, if I could grab a writing utensil…"
51,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Travis needs a writing utensil.
52,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Oh shit Paul, me too dog! I’m so sorry!"
53,Dallas Live Show,Travis, We’re children!
54,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I need a stylus.
55,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Look at this— [audience cheering for Paul]
56,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Paul, ladies and gentlemen! Paul of Paul and Storm."
57,Dallas Live Show,{4,16}
58,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Paul always carries around two big cups full of pencils, in his hands. Okay. So. The three of you are standing in an empty office featuring fairly humble trappings with two desks positioned side-by-side in front of a window overlooking an opulent city skyline. It’s been about six months— (softly, meekly) hey, uh, everyone here’s finished Balance, right? Okay, good—"
59,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Spoilers?
60,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, maybe a little bit."
61,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [underneath] You’ve had time!
62,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It’ll be light, it’s the name of the— it’s been six months since the Day of Story and Song and your lives had only just regained some semblance of normalcy when you received a letter inviting you to this office on this day. The three of you are kind of hard to pin down, I imagine, now given the fame you’ve acquired—"
63,Dallas Live Show,Travis, With the book tours—
64,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Separate lives. 
65,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah. Due to the fame you’ve acquired thanks to your heroism on that day. But the postscript on the letter was difficult to turn down, particularly for one of you. It read, “P.S Merle. C’mon. You owe us.” And the door to the office swings open and through it, you see the garage of the Goldcliff Battlewagon Racing League. Which is filled with vehicles being serviced by a dozen or so skilled mechanics, and through that door walk the dryads Hurley and Sloane. [The audience absolutely loses their shit.]"
66,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
67,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] You’ve heard of them?
68,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] So you’re familiar?
69,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And, uh—"
70,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Crystal Kingdom, I love this one."
71,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, No!
72,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Hell yeah. And they’ve got like, 80 crystals, and they’re like “We’ve gotta go back.”"
73,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And Hurley says
74,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Wow. To tell the truth, I thought there was a pretty slim chance you’d actually show up."
75,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, I’m SO bored.
76,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Was that Magnus or Travis?
77,Dallas Live Show,Travis," No, that was Magnus. That’s why he showed up."
78,Dallas Live Show,Justin," The importance of character voices, folks. If you don’t have a character voice before now—"
79,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I did it— That was— Listen— That was clearly loud and booming, which is not how I normally sound."
80,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And Sloane says
81,Dallas Live Show,        Sloane, How have the three of you been?
82,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, SO bored.
83,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Here, I’ll wave, I’ll put ‘em over there."
84,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Didn’t want you to miss the best view in the house. If you put ‘em up there, they’re still—"
85,Dallas Live Show,Clint, That’s blocking your view.
86,Dallas Live Show,Justin, There’s people right there. They need to—
87,Dallas Live Show,Sloane," So pretty good then, or—"
88,Dallas Live Show,Merle," Yeah, good, they’ve been good. Yeah, they’ve been—"
89,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Actually, I think these two— Dad, too— I’ve got some people here who can’t get a really good— Yeah, there you are. Hello. Scuttle Buddy, you’re so great."
90,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Scuttle Buddy! I know, right?"
91,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Listen, you paid full price, you’re gonna get the whole show, baby."
92,Dallas Live Show,Sloane," So the three of you’ve been okay, or—"
93,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," Yeah, we’ve been good. I’ve been training dogs. It’s gone… okay. It’s hard not to cuddle!"
94,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, That’s always been my experience.
95,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Now, was that Griffin?"
96,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, That was Griffin.
97,Dallas Live Show,Clint," I got into HQ, I’ve been playing a lot of HQ."
98,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, now this is Dad. Okay. Let’s take a minute."
99,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Oh, I thought you were asking me!"
100,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Now this is a podcast called The Adventure Zone in which we embody characters and we don’t necessarily answer questions as ourselves. And we’re all guilty of this.
101,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Oh, character voice! Right? Okay."
102,Dallas Live Show,        Merle, I’ve been playing a lot of HQ.
103,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
104,Dallas Live Show,Clint, No?
105,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Okay, but HQ doesn’t exist in this world…"
106,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," No, it’s a fantasy world. Technology exists."
107,Dallas Live Show,        Sloane," Taako, what about you?"
108,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Historical Quotient.
109,Dallas Live Show,        Sloane," Taako, I haven’t heard from you in a while."
110,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Yeah, I’m rich now. [audience cheers] Could be richer though. I’m here to promote my school, “Taako’s Correspondence School of Wizarding and Witchcraft.” We’re just trying to get the word out about the school. You can pay whenever you want, classes will start at some point. But we do encourage you— the slots are filling up quick, so you are gonna want to pay in advance. When this exciting project kicks off, as soon as we hit some private fundraising goals, it’s gonna be good."
111,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Hurley says"
112,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, Well maybe we can figure out some kind of cross-promotion—
113,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, You’re a tree!
114,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Yeah. Well… like, half-tree, I guess?"
115,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Awesome!
116,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Very cool.
117,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Yeah, it’s pretty cool. Bees can be a problem sometimes. "
118,Dallas Live Show,Merle, Yeah. Tell me about it.
119,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Oh, my God. I literally, this moment that you are sharing with me… That’s a wig, right? [Griffin laughs] This moment, I realized, “Hold on a sec! My dad got a white wig.”"
120,Dallas Live Show,Clint," It is a hot-ass wig, too. As a matter of fact hey, look in the back!"
121,Dallas Live Show,Justin, You’re stickin’ with it.
122,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Hurley says
123,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Well, things have been pretty good here for the most part. Took a while to clean the city up, but we managed just fine. Better than fine, actually. Now that the work’s done, Goldcliff citizens are just dying for entertainment. The battlewagon business has been booming, and that’s kinda why we called you all here. Why don’t you take a seat?"
124,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And she motions toward some chairs positioned in front of these desks.
125,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I do that.
126,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, uh, Sloane takes a poster and unfurls it."
127,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I rolled a 9 on taking the chair, what does that mean?"
128,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think you sit down, but the chair scoots backwards and makes a toot noise and you have to convince everybody..."
129,Dallas Live Show,        Magnus," Uh, wasn’t me!"
130,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Sloane unfurls this poster and you see a design advertising the Goldcliff Battlewagon Racing League Turbo Platinum Cup. Which takes place later today at the circuit located just outside the city. And then she unfurls it a bit further and it reads “Featuring Guest Racers Merle Highchurch, Taako, and Magnus Burnsides Three of the Saviors of Faerun.” [audience cheers]"
131,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Now, listen— you’re all great, and I love the way you reacted to that, but was it going to be like “Yeah, so, would you like to watch? I got you some comp tickets!”"
132,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Hurley says
133,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Looks pretty good, doesn’t it? This is our main event of the season, and well, we need to make as big of a splash as we possibly can. Like I mentioned earlier, the folks here are hungry for entertainment, and because of that, several less scrupulous competing racing leagues have popped up in the city. Leagues that don’t prioritize things like… oh, say, the continued lifespan of their racers, quite as much as we do."
134,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And, uh, Sloane says"
135,Dallas Live Show,Sloane," We’ve lost a fair chunk of our less discerning audience members to these leagues, but we’re hoping with the Turbo Platinum Cup today, we can re-establish ourselves as the premiere battlewagon league in Goldcliff and run those death races right out of town."
136,Dallas Live Show,Merle, Let me speak for the group
137,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay, but do it in a character voice."
138,Dallas Live Show,Merle," We’d be glad to, we know what you’re asking. Yes, we’ll sign the posters."
139,Dallas Live Show,Taako, I’m ready.
140,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Available for sale in the lobby.
141,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And then you walk off into the sunset.
142,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Thanks for comin’ out, everybody."
143,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Goodnight everybody!
144,Dallas Live Show,        Taako, I’d rather not.
145,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Hurley says
146,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Now, I understand you’re worried given how hectic your last race with us ended up being."
147,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Hectic? You—
148,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And then imagine I referenced something that happened in it.
149,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yeah, because it was four arcs ago."
150,Dallas Live Show,        Taako, There was a shark tank!
151,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," There was a shark tank, you did remember that. And she turned into, like, a giant vine monster and that was pretty wild. [Taako Eh. There was a shark tank.] But listen, you really—"
152,Dallas Live Show,Merle, Sounds good to me. ;)
153,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," You don’t have to sweat anything— gross. We don’t— we’ve really gone legitimate since then. All of our racers are equipped with new and improved safety harnesses, they do the bubble thing, remember? But they also have a charge of, oh, what’s that spell? Spare the Dying? Merle, do you know that one? "
154,Dallas Live Show,Merle," ...Yeah, yeah, yeah."
155,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," You hesitated, so it seems— it seems like you’re looking at a list of cards with spells you know."
156,Dallas Live Show,Merle," Yeah, I got it."
157,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, Okay.
158,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, She says
159,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Anyway, death and dismemberment; it’s really not part of the equation anymore. We figured we can give folks a show without getting too gruesome about it. {{1225}}  "
160,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," So you’ll each have one of these harnesses out there, I’ll be driving, and really, y’all appearing in the race at all is gonna be a huge attraction in and of itself. We don’t even need to win."
161,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Bullshit.
162,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Yeah we’re— We will win.
163,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Hurley smiles, she says—"
164,Dallas Live Show,        Magnus, And we’re going to be amazing. [audience cheers]
165,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughing] Oh that was cheap. That was so cheap.
166,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Yes it was!
167,Dallas Live Show, Justin," So we’re at that phase now, right? Where we’re just…"
168,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Just stand up on stage Play the hits! Uh Abra-ca-fuck you? I don’t know. [audience laughter]
169,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Glad we got that out of the way.
170,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Sloane says
171,Dallas Live Show,Sloane, I’ll be up in the press box making sure everything runs smoothly. Teams cap out at four and I’ve taken on a more managerial role in the organization anyway.
172,Dallas Live Show,        Magnus, Really put down roots. [Clint laughs]
173,Dallas Live Show,        Sloane, Aw Jesus. [mixed laughs and boos from the audience]
174,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Aw come on.
175,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Come on! [audience cheers] That was as Magnus. Travis would never make that joke. 
176,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Let him weave— Let him weave his tapestry.
177,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Sloane says
178,Dallas Live Show,Sloane," Also there is a grand prize of 6,000 gold pieces for the winning team, and I can— I can promise you Merle also that the next time one of your kids is endangered by an interdimensional cosmic force of mass destruction we’ll just… Go right ahead and save them again. Does that sound… Equitable?"
179,Dallas Live Show,Merle," That’s hitting me where I live, man."
180,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," You don’t live with your kids, Merle."
181,Dallas Live Show,Merle, No I don’t live with my kids. And we’re all the better for it! {{1410}}
182,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," So Hurley and Sloane walk the three of you out into the garage and you see several battlewagons being serviced but the showpiece here, is on a rotating platform at the end of the room. It’s the Ram. And it's just how you remember it; sleek and black with silver armor plating, a harpoon gun mounted on the roof."
183,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Can you do this in Denis Leary’s voice?
184,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, I don’t think I could.
185,Dallas Live Show,Clint," No, okay. {{1428}}"
186,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It’s got a long trunk that Magnus did so many stunts off of back in the day. And of course, a metallic Ram’s Head positioned at the front. It's a thing of beauty and Hurley says"
187,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," I haven't made too many tweaks to the old Ram. It's hard to improve on perfection, but something tells me the three of you have learned some new tricks since your last go around, huh?"
188,Dallas Live Show,Merle, Ye— yeah— 
189,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Nope! [audience laughs]
190,Dallas Live Show,Taako, You would think so.
191,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," You look like you’ve leveled up like eight times or so, you should— [crosstalk]"
192,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Oh! Yeah yeah yeah.
193,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Yeah. We’re still very judicious with our spellslots though, let’s not go… wild."
194,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, She says
195,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Well, when we get out there you’re just gonna have to put on a good show. Nothing too gruesome, okay? I mean you can’t actually kill anyone but still folks might find some gnarly stuff—"
196,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Question.
197,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, Yes.
198,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Can’t? Or should not.
199,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Can’t. I mean, the belts will allow you not to— They won’t allow you to die."
200,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Excellent.
201,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, Yeah. Uh so flag’s up in a couple hours we should probably get a move on. Oh! That reminds me.
202,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And Sloane walks over to a crate and pops it open, pulls out a few items."
203,Dallas Live Show,Sloane, I've got a little memento for you. 
204,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And what she withdraws from the crate are three masks [crowd cheers] that you wore during your first battlewagon race. In the shapes of a bear, an owl, and a mongoose!"
205,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Now you told him! You told him that, didn’t ya?"
206,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I was actually given this [the bear mask from the first battle wagon race] at C2E2, and it is my new favorite hat."
207,Dallas Live Show,Clint, That’s not surprising.
208,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Why didn’t you have it when you came on before?
209,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I was gonna wear it one way or the other.
210,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
211,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I was waiting for just the right moment. My theatricality— No.
212,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Let’s fast-forward, ‘cause we’ve have spent a long time— Jesus. You’re outside now, whoa, and you’re walking the streets of Goldcliff toward the circuit at the edge of town. And sure enough The town’s doing great. There are few signs of the attack that took place just earlier that year. There’s just sort of happy, well-dressed folks enjoying the pleasant weather. And one of these well-dressed folks, a male halfling dressed to the nines approaches the three of you and says"
213,Dallas Live Show,Halfling," Good evening gentlemen. Do I have the pleasure of speaking to Merle, Magnus, and Taako, three of the saviours of Faerun? "
214,Dallas Live Show,Taako, You tell me.
215,Dallas Live Show,Halfling, You… tell me!
216,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Yes.
217,Dallas Live Show,Clint, He will.
218,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Now.
219,Dallas Live Show,Halfling," My— my name is Alfred D’Gaul and I’d love to bend your ear just for a moment, I re— I realize you’re on your way to the big race, but I think you’re going to want to hear what I have to say."
220,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Sponsorship opportunity? I love it, talk."
221,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, Oh we could talk sponsorships all day.
222,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Oh no, you’re becoming one voice! [audience laughs]"
223,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, he says"
224,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," I operate a humble, but growing racing league here in town called the Blaze Wings. Now I know you’re probably thinking; “Hey that sounds like we’re describing an especially spicy flavor of buffalo wings. Perhaps the type that a restaurant might offer as some sort of food challenge to its diners.” But actually, no. It’s a very good name for our organization."
225,Dallas Live Show,Clint and Justin, [laughing]
226,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Now I’m not sure what Hurley and Sloane have offered the three of you to participate in today’s festivities, but I’d like to make a counter-offer if I might. All you have to do is walk away, right now, and I will match the prize money offered for the race; six-thousand gold pieces for literally no work at all."
227,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, [crosstalk] Like no—
228,Dallas Live Show,Merle," No, they offered us ten."
229,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, ...Ten thousand?
230,Dallas Live Show,Merle," Yep. They said ten, ten thousand."
231,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, He uh...
232,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Euros.
233,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Well, I’m gonna need you to roll, a die, please, Clinton."
234,Dallas Live Show,Clinton, [crosstalk] Okay—
235,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah roll a bl— uh, uh, what’s it called? Deception check."
236,Dallas Live Show,Clint, (quietly) ...That’s this one?
237,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Yep.
238,Dallas Live Show,[Audience laughing],
239,Dallas Live Show,Travis, A six!
240,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] That’s a...
241,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] I also—
242,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] I can read!
243,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, I also rolled a six. [audience laughs] I think he— I think he pulls out a pocketbook and he’s like
244,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Ten thous— Ten th— We can probably make ten thousand work, we could do the last four thousand in, in [cross talk] installments maybe?"
245,Dallas Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Wait wait, to be fair, he— [Merle Down.] he gets a plus one to deception."
246,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay yeah,"
247,Dallas Live Show,Travis, So that’s a seven.
248,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, That’s a success.
249,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Yeah, I can make ten thousand work. "
250,Dallas Live Show,Merle, I meant ten thousand down. [audience laughs]
251,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, How much is the juice?
252,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [laughs] You got points runnin’ on it [crosstalk] 
253,Dallas Live Show,Merle," The vig— the vig is another five Gs, man. {{1838}}"
254,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Hey listen, we’re the saviours of Faerun, heroes of the land; we don’t need to discuss this. Yes. "
255,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs]
256,Dallas Live Show,Taako, You have a deal. 
257,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Wait… Do we get it up front?
258,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, Sure just sign here on this contract and ah—
259,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, You got it!
260,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Alright, he shows you a contract! "
261,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Magnus signs and then walks towards the Ram.
262,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
263,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," He hands you a bag with 10,000 gold pieces in it, down. "
264,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Wait, 10,000 apiece?"
265,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Total, to split. "
266,Dallas Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Oh, no, no. Wait, come on!"
267,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Oh! Okay.
268,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
269,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Do you have a plan for if we just take the money and run? 
270,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Well you seem like good, enterprising folks who—"
271,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs]
272,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I’m talking to Griffin! 
273,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, No. 
274,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Okay, cause Taako says yes. I don’t understand why these other two did. Taako says yes I will take that offer. "
275,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Oh, I was just gonna take it and then still do the race anyway. "
276,Dallas Live Show,Justin, That seems— okay.
277,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Wait, did you just say that out loud?"
278,Dallas Live Show,Justin & Travis, No! 
279,Dallas Live Show,Clint, That was Travis’ voice. 
280,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Wait, let me run it back— [rewinding bloops]"
281,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, I would never! 
282,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Okay Merle, hurry up and talk us into doing this, 'cause I think—"
283,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think he’s good, no, I think he does it! You hand him a contract and he hands you 10,000 gold pieces. He says "
284,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, I’ll talk to your people about getting the rest of the money to you. 
285,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Sounds great. 
286,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Sounds like we have a deal! Well, I’m gonna turn my back and walk away now, and not pay attention to where you go from here. [audience laughs] See ya!"
287,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And he does! And now you have 10,000 gold pieces. "
288,Dallas Live Show,"Clint, Travis, and Justin", Yay!
289,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Can we buy some shit? 
290,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, no. "
291,Dallas Live Show,Justin," I know that it probably seems like that was really scummy of us, but we’re gonna give some of it to a local Dallas charity. "
292,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [laughs]
293,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Now you feel bad! Now you’re the bad guy!
294,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Who deserves 5,000 fantasy gold pieces?"
295,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Whoah, whoah, whoah."
296,Dallas Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] 5,000? Come on, Dad. 2,000. "
297,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Hang on, Dad. "
298,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay so it’s a short while later, I guess you’ve headed to the circuit and taken your places for the race. You’re sitting inside—"
299,Dallas Live Show,Travis, After buying a lot of candy. 
300,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah. You’re sitting inside of Hurley’s wagon within a large crate, just like last time, positioned at the starting line, and the engine is puttering. Fortunately, you’re—"
301,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Pumping in time? Does the green light flash, the flag go up? "
302,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh, stop. "
303,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers] ,
304,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Fortunately, this wagon runs on an arcane core, so there’s no fumes to inhale, which I only just thought of while I was prepping this part. "
305,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs]
306,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Merle, you’re in the front passenger seat, Taako, you are standing in this cut-out space in the roof, where the harpoon gun is mounted, and Magnus, you are on the trunk, connected to the car with wires you have attached to loops on your harness. Basically the same arrangement as last time. And Hurley says from the driver’s seat "
307,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Okay, it’s a sold-out crowd today. We’re not racing for the fate of the planet or anything, so let’s just have some fun out there. "
308,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Let’s murder!
309,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," What’s, what? "
310,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, What? 
311,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, What did you say?
312,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, What did you say? 
313,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, I said let’s have fun!
314,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Yeah!
315,Dallas Live Show,Taako, I still don’t understand why I have to do this. That nice halfling said that he’d give me money not to. 
316,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," All we had to do was put some ink on paper. That means nothing in this world, there’s no lawyers or anything! What are they gonna do, take us to centaur court? Come on! "
317,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Some of us have businesses. I’m an LLC now. 
318,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, There’s no lawyers. But there’s necromancers. [eerily]
319,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Ohhh.
320,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Alright. 
321,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," That’s nothing. [laughs] I’m not, no- And outside of the crate you hear two high pitched beeps, and then Hurley says "
322,Dallas Live Show,Hurley, I love this part. 
323,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And then a third beep, and the door to the crate drops, and Hurley slams on the gas. "
324,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah! 
325,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Woo!
326,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And you are temporarily blinded as you emerge from the crate and quickly your eyes acclimate to the sunlight, and you try to take in your sort of chaotic surroundings. The circuit is nothing like the last track that you raced on. If you remember it was just kind of out in the desert with these pylons that people watched through. "
327,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yeah, I remember. "
328,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It used to be illegal, but now it’s totally cool here. There are actual stands now, reaching upward a couple of stories surrounding the track, just, filled with people. There’s no need for the viewers of this sport to remain anonymous anymore, and there are fifteen other battle wagons on the course with you tonight, and their designs are just as diverse as you expected, but there’s far too much movement and dust being kicked up for you to sort of, take down a mental list of them, and for several moments, Hurley shifts her wagon through several gears as you weave through the crowd, until, several hundred feet from the starting line, the wagons fall into an order. You’re in fifth place, let’s roll initiative. "
329,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers] ,
330,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Ah, Hoops has thirteen plus three, sixteen. "
331,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I have a six plus two, eight. "
332,Dallas Live Show,Clint," I have an eighteen, [audience cheers], plus…"
333,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Base setter, that seems like a good sign. "
334,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Where? Yeah! Plus two, twenty! "
335,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Good roll. Okay. Y’all, I live in Texas, I feel really guilty about the ‘yeehaw’ thing. [audience laughs] I know that ain’t you. Okay, anyway. Hurley drafts behind the vehicle in front of you, and then pulls alongside it, bringing you into combat range. This wagon, like those you’ve faced before, has a peculiar design. It resembles a metallic, fifteen foot long caterpillar, with five segmented, armoured compartments, each with a pair of sharp, iron legs that skitter quickly across the racetrack, pounding the dirt as it runs. The vehicle’s sole passenger, a clean-shaven dwarven man, is controlling the caterpillar from inside of a glass-domed cockpit on the front segment. He eyes your vehicle, and starts to steer the caterpillar into a collision course with your battle wagon. Merle! You’re up first. Uh oh. "
336,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Don’t fuck up. 
337,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I’m going to cast…
338,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Okay. 
339,Dallas Live Show,        Merle, I’m going to cast—
340,Dallas Live Show,Travis," No. No, you were right. Unless Merle is announcing, to the car, that—"
341,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [imitating Merle] Big news, everybody!"
342,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Shield of Faith!
343,Dallas Live Show,??, On—?
344,Dallas Live Show,Clint," It’s a shimmering field, appearing and surrounding a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to ack [AC] for the duration. [audience laughs] "
345,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Who are you casting this spell on? 
346,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Ahh… Oh! Ahh… [audience laughs] Ah, Taako! On Taako. "
347,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [laughs] 
348,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I cast it on Taako. 
349,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay! Alright! Taako, you have +2 AC. "
350,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [to Travis] You have a shield!
351,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I’m the fucking tank! 
352,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Doesn’t matter! Alright! You cast the shield on Taako. 
353,Dallas Live Show,Travis," It’s like you ran a marathon, and you made it to the last ten feet and then went, [crosstalk] ‘what’ and then made a hard right... "
354,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Don’t meta-game, this is beautiful. Merle had to make—"
355,Dallas Live Show,Clint, It’ll always work out!
356,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Merle had to make a panicked, command decision, and he just, did Taako. This is like that episode of Friends, where they were all the backseat— hold on, everybody— there’s a backseat in a taxi, and they hear what they thought was a gunshot, and then Joey jumped in front of Ross, and Chandler’s like, ‘what the fuck?’, but really Joey’s diving for his sandwich! [laughs] Fuck!"
357,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Fuck that’s good! 
358,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Taako, you’re up. "
359,Dallas Live Show,Clint, And you’re welcome. 
360,Dallas Live Show,Justin, So what’s happening now? 
361,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Caterpillar is getting closer, almost like it’s going to act next. "
362,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs] ,
363,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Ahm… I am going to cast a little evocation just to get things started. Ah, I am gonna cast— I’m not checking texts, by the way—"
364,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, seeing how the Max Fun Drive is going."
365,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Yeah, still time to donate. [audience laughs] Ah, okay. I am going to cast Immolation! "
366,Dallas Live Show,Others, Oh! 
367,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. I’m counting the—
368,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yep. 
369,Dallas Live Show,Justin, It’s a creature. 
370,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," The caterpillar? The vehicle, or the driver? "
371,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Inside the driver, would be safer for us, so I’m going to say—"
372,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Inside the cockpit? 
373,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Inside the cockpit. 
374,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Okay, sure. "
375,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Inside the driver. 
376,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, This is horrible. These safety harnesses will save you from death. I don’t know how that works [crosstalk] if you fill his cockpit with fire.
377,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Burn him from the inside! 
378,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs] 
379,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I did ask— 
380,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," His charred corpse steps out of the cockpit, yeeah... "
381,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I did ask for clarification between can’t and shouldn’t. 
382,Dallas Live Show,Justin, It’s like prison! I’m killing one early so they know not to fuck with me!
383,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, okay. Roll that beautiful bean footage. "
384,Dallas Live Show,Justin, So you have to make a dexterity saving throw. 
385,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I got another six. Wait, plus two, eight. "
386,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [raspberry noise] That’s a big ‘N’ ‘O’ on that one good buddy, you’re gonna need to take 7d6 fire damage. "
387,Dallas Live Show,Clint," [singing] Burn, baby, burn!"
388,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Don’t worry, he has a safety harness on. "
389,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay. Okay. 
390,Dallas Live Show,Justin, You’re also gonna be burning for a minute. 
391,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Juice? Do not worry about that part. [audience laughs] I think the 7d6 is just gonna get me. Go ahead and roll your d6. Actually, wait, I can do a—"
392,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Also, you know what, this is neither here nor there, but you are also shedding a bright light in a 30ft radius. [giggles] I don’t know if that’s-"
393,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs] 
394,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And the crowd goes wild. 
395,Dallas Live Show,"[the crowd does indeed, go wild]",
396,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, I got a 34. 
397,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Wait a second, hold on, hold on, hold on. It’s up, there you are. "
398,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah. Not surprising bear hat, very warm. "
399,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," 34 fire damage, as you just see this dwarven man like ‘Eyy?’ [immolation noise] "
400,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [laughs] 
401,Dallas Live Show,Taako, You’ll be fine! 
402,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And then there’s a 30ft radius of bright light, [audience laughs] and that’s cool. "
403,Dallas Live Show,Justin," And it makes a spotlight on Taako, and he goes "
404,Dallas Live Show,Taako, Sign up for my school! 
405,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers] ,
406,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think for added effect as well, the cockpit is soundproof, so you just see like [presumably does something amusing]"
407,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [laughs]
408,Dallas Live Show,Justin," That’s gonna make good podcast listening, Griff! "
409,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And they are not dead, but—"
410,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Sad. 
411,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Beaten. Vanquished. However, he was going to act next. The caterpillar was on a trajectory to collide with the car, and I think it still, sort of, was moving in that direction, and tries to trample over the vehicle. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw. "
412,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Eighteen, plus two, twenty. "
413,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Eleven. 
414,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Five?
415,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Wowzers. 
416,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Plus one, six!"
417,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh that’s good! No. No. Magnus is safe, Taako and Merle, you take 22 points of piercing damage. "
418,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hachi-machi! {{2945}}
419,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, As the legs—
420,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Wow. That sucks for you, pal. "
421,Dallas Live Show,Justin," You too, dog. "
422,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And with that, the caterpillar just goes completely over you, and I think it just tilts over, and falls to the side, and crashes into the side barrier of the track. "
423,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Aww. 
424,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I was gonna do something so cool, too. "
425,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Well, there’s more wagons. And I think as it falls, you see the cockpit tumble open, and you see this dwarf come out, and he just looks kinda like, singed, and he’s just like, ‘huh, oh well!’, but he’s totally fine. "
426,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs] ,
427,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And he kinda has a look, like, ‘ugh, what a day.’ "
428,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," He kicks the dust, he’s like, ‘aww, shoot!’ "
429,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Well, next time! "
430,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Hurley takes a turn with expert precision, putting you just behind, bumper to bumper, the next wagon in the order. This vehicle has a long, cylindrical body. It has a narrow cannon in front, a single, huge exhaust pipe at its rear, and just behind the cannon, is a glass tank filled with a strange, yellowish fluid. It is a giant vape pen. Anyway. [audience laughs] It has four gerblin passengers, all saddled on top like a rowing team. The rear rider sees your wagon behind them and it shouts out and suddenly the exhaust pipe at the rear end of the vehicle emits a massive plume of fog, obscuring your vision, and hiding this vehicle and the entire racetrack from your sight. Magnus, you’re up. {{3118}}"
431,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Of all the people [Indistinguishable audience shout] well [giggle] What is the..?
432,Dallas Live Show,Justin," We don’t actually, but if we use your thing everybody will know the jig is up."
433,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Is the vehicle metallic?
434,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It is.
435,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Cool.
436,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Except for the vape juice container. The flavor by the way is…
437,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Peas.
438,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Mango.
439,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," PEA-FLAVORED VAPE!? [audience laughter] Go to jail. [audience laughs louder] Mango. It’s mango mint, so you get those tropical notes and then you get like a “ooh” but “oooh!” [audience laughter]. Magnus, you’re taking heavy rips on the trunk, what do you do?"
440,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Right now I’m just enjoying it, frankly."
441,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I will say, sort of the mechanic here, 'cause this is kinda how it worked last time if you want Hurley to reposition in any way or do any sort of maneuver to aid... specifically I think this applies mostly to you [meaning Travis/Magnus] since your shit's all sort of physical."
442,Dallas Live Show,Travis, How close were we to it?
443,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Just behind ‘em like, bumper to bumper."
444,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay great. So, can I get to the front of the car?"
445,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah sure, you have to unhook yourself. Oh, no, the rails run front to back."
446,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yes, so I get to the front of the car."
447,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
448,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And I deploy my magnetic charge.
449,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh shit, what?"
450,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, my magnetic charge."
451,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, I forgot I— you— Yes!
452,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Fist-sized ball that produces magnetic field that repels metal objects.
453,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, You remembered you had a magic item!
454,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yes I did. [Audience Cheers] And I kind of, as I activate it, chuck it towards the vape pen car."
455,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uhh, okay, what we have to figure out. I’m totally into this... Hurley’s battle wagon is also metal."
456,Dallas Live Show,Travis, That’s why I threw it forward.
457,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, but where are you kinda aiming it on the vehicle."
458,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Forward.
459,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, To the front of the vape pen?
460,Dallas Live Show,Travis, To the exhaust pipe. Mmmm...
461,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
462,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [laughs] 
463,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay. Here's what I’ll say, normally you could just— be able to do this. You can’t see because of the plume of fog instead of giving you disadvantage or anything, I think it’s just a straight up like, attack roll of you throwing this thing plus dex."
464,Dallas Live Show,Travis, 14 plus dex is a 16.
465,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
466,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Wait. Wait wait wait. I thought he had disadvantage. Doesn’t that mean he has to roll twice?
467,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," No no, he doesn’t have disadvantage that’s what I said. Okay, you throw the magnetic charge…"
468,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I mean plus if it’s an attack roll I get like…
469,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah you’re cool, you get like plus a hundred. You throw the magnetic charge forward, into the exhaust pipe, Luke?"
470,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, fuck it. [audience laughs] Listen, we got an hour and a half to get through this whole thing?"
471,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah sure.
472,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I throw it in the fuckin’ exhaust pipe, ay."
473,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay here’s what happens. You throw it in the exhaust pipe and it disappears as it goes into the exhaust pipe and then the magnet expands. I don’t know how this would work.
474,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, it sets off a charge of—"
475,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It sets off the charge. I think the way that this sort of works is the back half of the vehicle tears itself apart. I think it just rips itself apart and now it’s a kind of— maybe a little— a humble vape pen. They don’t all have to be real long folks. Uhhhhh, I’m not doing that joke. But the back half of it— two of the gerblins just go flying. And shrapnel is shredding their bodies, but then they're like, “Hey heyyy.”"
476,Dallas Live Show,Justin, It’s all in fun!
477,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s great! And you have essentially taken care of half of the vehicle. 
478,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Okay so that’s my first attack. [audience laughs] 
479,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [Laughs]
480,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Wait, and after you threw that… [audience laughs]"
481,Dallas Live Show,Clint," For those of you listening at home, Justin is leaning over talking to Travis."
482,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And when it lands and explodes, Magnus goes,"
483,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Cotton!
484,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah yeah, sure. All right, and what do you do for your next attack? And look at that timer."
485,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Are there more gerblins on the thing?
486,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, There’s two more gerblins.
487,Dallas Live Show,Clint, We are hell on gerblins. 
488,Dallas Live Show,Travis, So it’s a distance thing? 
489,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yes. Also because you blew up the back half, the smog is no longer coming out, it is a broken vape."
490,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay, I am going to need my Chance Lance. [audience cheer] I’m trusting that it’s gonna be there."
491,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Let’s pause for a moment.
492,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Paulandstorm.gov [presumably because Paul came onstage briefly.]
493,Dallas Live Show,Travis," These were made by @saltyspunny on Twitter, who brought them for us."
494,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s so fucking sick.
495,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Thank you.
496,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Folks at home. Travis has a Chance Lance.
497,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I have a beautiful Chance Lance.
498,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s real.
499,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I hurl—
500,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Throw it at the audience dude, come on. "
501,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Okay yeah.
502,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [Laughs] ""Tragedy tonight as a—"""
503,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I hurl it at one of the gerblins. Is one of them driving?
504,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, They’re both driving.
505,Dallas Live Show,Travis, What?!
506,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s like a bobsled.
507,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Okay but what is the—
508,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Except one of them is a student driver.
509,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [Laughs]
510,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, I will say they’re in a row.
511,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay, I throw it at one of them, I don’t fucking care. So that’s — now that appears to be a failure, but it is six plus ten so that’s 16."
512,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," That’s a hit, my friend."
513,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Being a warrior rules! And then it is— 
514,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s called fighter.
515,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Well actually, it’s I think bruiser or whatever— oh no, ruff boi."
516,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Ruff boi. [Audience cheers]
517,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I didn’t do much damage, I only did six damage."
518,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s not very much."
519,Dallas Live Show,Travis, But then I call it back to me.
520,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, here’s how it works."
521,Dallas Live Show,Travis, How does the bubble handle piercing damage exactly?
522,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Here’s how it works, you throw it and you hit the back one and it also goes through the front one. They both take six damage, and as you call it back it does six more damage, for a total of twelve damage. And with that, both gerblins— they’re just gerblins— they—"
523,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [Laughs]
524,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, —slump off the side of the wagon and I think it just kind of just slows down.
525,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And I turn to Taako and I say,"
526,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, What are the chances?
527,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay. We can’t. Half the audience— half the time is spe—
528,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I don’t care what you think.
529,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You’re losing them, Travis."
530,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I do, I care very much."
531,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think vape pen— kind of half vape pen just kind of slows down and Hurley has to steer the battle wagon around it to get in front of it. And then you see just two more wagons. I put cars here. This is the only time I missed it. You see two more wagons between you and first place and as Hurley brings your wagon into range of them it almost seems like they slow down, so as to put you right between them. And that’s when you recognize that these two nearly identical vehicles are working in tandem. They’re both imposing figures. These eight foot high rectangles of rusted brass, each one has four antennae positioned at their corners, and they’re all facing you. And from your position you can just barely see these small rectangular vents on the front sides of these rectangular wagons which you assume to be the view ports through which the racers inside are watching the track. The one on your left is outlined with a red trim around its edges and the one on your right is outlined in blue. Merle you’re up. Two wagons, one to the left, one to the right, big rectangles with antennae on them."
532,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Rectangles with antennae. Oooh.
533,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [Clears throat] 
534,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Okay Merle casts—
535,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Here we go.
536,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Gate!
537,Dallas Live Show,Travis, What? A third spell?
538,Dallas Live Show,Clint, He conjures a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range in a precise location on a different plane of existence. [audience laughs]
539,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Okay... What?
540,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, No no no. Good. Good good good.
541,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Okay, and I’m gonna cast it in front of the blue one."
542,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Ah, you’ve disarmed the bomb— that’s not how this works. It’s fine. Okay, do I do anything? Or…"
543,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Uh… The victim cannot do anything, they just have to go into the gate."
544,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Travis, what’s the fuckin' card say? [audience laughs]"
545,Dallas Live Show,Clint," The portal is a circular opening, which, I need my glasses for the second half of this show."
546,Dallas Live Show,Travis, You have a son.
547,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Okay, thanks."
548,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Let me just read it.
549,Dallas Live Show,Clint, 'Cause I can’t see shit.
550,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," How big is the opening Travis, like the size of like a..."
551,Dallas Live Show,Travis," It is five to twenty feet in diameter, the portal lasts the duration which is up to one minute."
552,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Five feet in diameter, okay. You conjure a gate in front of the blue one, and it’s five feet in diameter…"
553,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Five to twenty feet. Five to twenty.
554,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Five to twenty feet. What plane of existence are you sending them to? Don’t say the Hunger, 'cause that’s gone."
555,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Oh... Uhhhhh.
556,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Heads up, you’re welcome."
557,Dallas Live Show,Clint, The astral plane. Y’know where—
558,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [Laughs] [Audience laughs and cheers]
559,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Where astral shit hangs out.
560,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," That’s the plane of the after-life, and that’s very good."
561,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
562,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," So, okay."
563,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yeah, they’re going there. To that—that plane. That’s the plane…"
564,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Tell me more about these harnesses. Yeah, very good harnesses today I hope."
565,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," We see— okay— you see this gate appear in front of the blue one and all of you see the blue one just like at speed with you, and then you see like a flat line of like, blue fire, and then it passes through it and then it’s just not next to you anymore and then we cut to Barry, Lup and Kravitz. [audience cheers] And they’re talking to the Raven Queen and she’s giving them a dire mission and there’s windows, they’re in the prison where they do all their work. There’s huge windows outside and you see the endless sea of souls outside, and they’re talking and it’s a mission of much import. And then just this giant car just, vwoomp, falls past the window, and they all look to the side, and then they just look back, shrug, resume talking."
566,Dallas Live Show,Travis," ""Merle, probably Merle."""
567,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And then from inside we see this halfling, and he’s inside the thing just like, looking through the window at this sea of souls he’s falling through but he’s just like,"
568,Dallas Live Show,Halfling," I’m okay, I guess? [Clint and Justin laughing in background] This one’s weird."
569,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Taako— {4200}
570,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I know what the next live episode is gonna be. Go to rescue that poor son of a bitch.
571,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Taako, you are up. You just have the red rectangle wagon now."
572,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Ummm. Is it posing any threat?
573,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yes, so those antennae now have started to spark a little bit with electricity, almost as if they had you sandwiched between them that was gonna be a really cool big attack, but then."
574,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Ooohhh. Aaahhh. Okay, that’s why you gave me that really shitty look."
575,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I gave you an excited look, that was very good."
576,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Well, he didn’t expect you to be competent."
577,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yeah, that’s true. Fooled him. [Travis and Clint laugh]"
578,Dallas Live Show,Travis, It only took three years of hustling.
579,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," What you got, Taako?"
580,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [Sigh] I’m gonna do another magic.
581,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
582,Dallas Live Show,Travis, What?
583,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Here’s one of the magics— and you know I’m trying to make it—
584,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Do some fun.
585,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Just trying to do something fun.
586,Dallas Live Show,Clint," The people of Dallas deserve fun. [audience cheers] Give them some fun, dammit."
587,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I don’t know what that means.
588,Dallas Live Show,Clint," I know, I know."
589,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I got you.
590,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
591,Dallas Live Show,Justin," So Taako extends his fingers, and you expect there to be like, fire and shit but instead you just get [Beatboxing] It’s a bass, there’s a bass line and then he wiggles his ring finger and a melody extends [Beatboxing]"
592,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Is he playing Drop Mix on the—
593,Dallas Live Show,Justin," No, he’s playing Otto's Irresistible Dance. It’s a sixth level enchantment. Don’t worry about rolling, it says ""irresistible"" right there in the title. "
594,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [Laughs]
595,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Choose one creature you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place, shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration of one minute. That is on the driver, obviously."
596,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah sure. A hatch on the top of the vehicle pops open and you see another halfling pop up and is now sort of Teen Wolf surfing on top of this vehicle. And then he just starts doing the Cupid Shuffle, but so hard. Like hitting it so fucking hard. Just like slide to the left like URGH! And then he slides to the right and falls off the fucking battlewagon."
597,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [Laughs] And then pops up from the ground and goes—
598,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And he gives a big thumbs up. And he looks around and he’s like,"
599,Dallas Live Show,Halfling, Where’s my friend? That’s my best friend. He’s getting married tomorrow and I’m his best man.
600,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, As you conquer the two electrified wagons and leave them in your dust you see nothing ahead of you but empty track and the smoking rubble of a few of your competitors.
601,Dallas Live Show,Travis, We’re gonna wrap this up early.
602,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," This has been a particularly battle-filled battle wagon race it would seem, but there’s nobody ahead of you to challenge your final lap. Behind you though, is another story. You turn in unison to the sound of massive footsteps and see, quickly approaching, a massive battle wagon in the shape of a tyrannosaurus rex. It is impressively to scale, with razor sharp fangs, small cute arms, and two massive legs that are currently bounding towards you gaining speed. And it lowers its head to ram your wagon and behind its eyes, you see its driver, a human smiling with sinister intent. And then... the T-Rex explodes. As—"
603,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Ohh I was gonna say faster, must go faster, and you fucking stole it."
604,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh, say it."
605,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," Faster, must go fast—"
606,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And then the T-Rex explodes.
607,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Thank you.
608,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," As does the ground around and behind you. And when the smoke clears, the T-Rex is gone, and you see its racer flailing away from the scene but still pretty good. And then you hear whistling from above, and then more explosions which Hurley weaves through deftly. But the heat of the bombs is flashing against your face…"
609,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Oh shit, we’re in the Red Zone."
610,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And you f— Nerd Alert. And you follow the sound of the whistling upward and find in the sky, three flying vehicles above you. A wide winged metallic bomber that’s readying another salvo. A dragon-shaped vehicle with wings covered in bright red canvas, and a small wooden skimmer with an auto crossbow mounted wings—"
611,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Blaze Wings!
612,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And each of you— thanks, Travis, that’s great— and each of these planes is towing a colorful banner behind, and when read together they read, “Want a real race? Take to the sky with... the Blaze Wings.” [others laugh] We’re gonna take intermission, we will be right back. We’ve got posters and merch in the lobby. Go and we’ll be back soon. Bye."
613,Dallas Live Show,[Interlude music],
614,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Hey everybody this is Griffin McElroy, your dungeon master, your best friend and your big dog. Woof woof, where’s mah big dogs at? Thanks for listening to The Adventure Zone, our live show from Dallas from earlier this year. Hope that you are enjoying it, we’re putting up a live show this episode because Travis was on an extended vacation so we needed some to cover for him, but we'll be back in two weeks on Thursday May 31st with a new episode in the Amnesty arc. We’re gonna be getting back to that soon, but for right now let me tell you about some of our sponsors. First off I want to tell you about Casper. Casper is fantastic, they’re a sleep brand that continues to revolutionise the line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience, one night at a time. They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman and sells directly to the consumer. We have a Casper mattress that we use in our guest room and we get so many compliments from folks who are like, best sleep I’ve ever had, soft, good for back, great for dreams had sweet dreams about Scott Bakula and his handsome body, and it was a great dream, and thank you to Casper. Casper brand mattresses contain multiple supported memory foams for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of sink, and the right amount of bounce. You can be sure your purchase with their 100 night, risk free, sleep on it trial. You can get 50 dollars towards select mattresses by visiting Casper.com/adventure and using the promo code “adventure” at check out. Terms and conditions apply. I also want to tell you about Blue Apron, you know about Blue Apron. They’re the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country. When it comes to dinner let Blue Apron take care of the planning and the chopping while you do the cooking and the eating. You’ll enjoy delicious meals like popcorn chicken with sweet chili cabbage slaw, and cumin spiced wonton noodles with vegetables and peanuts on the table in thirty minutes or less. With incredible ingredients and chef designed recipes, Blue Apron lets you see what the power of food can do. We love Blue Apron, I have made so many tasty meals with Blue Apron, and also learned how to cook things. I can cook the Blue Apron things, I can cook other things. I can cook a soup. I can cook a bread, and that’s all the food I can think of right now. So check out this week’s menu and get your first three meals free at blueapron.com/adventure. Blue Apron, a better way to cook. Got a Chumbotron here, and for thi— Did I call it a “Chumbotron”? I’m gonna email Jesse and see if we can change the name of that. This Chumbotron is about the Once and Future Nerd, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts. Or you can say hey to them on Twitter, Tumblr, or Facebook. The Once and Future Nerd is a tale about three teenagers from Pennsylvania who are transported to a fantasy world on the brink of civil war. As they take their new reality into their own hands they meet a colorful cast of misfits, fulfill and break all those fantasy tropes you love, or hate, and discover power they never even imagined. This epic saga is brought to life with sound effects, score, and a full cast of award-winning actors doing their damndest to make you laugh and or feel things. Aww that sounds nice, I haven’t felt something in a while, and that sounds bleak but maybe I’ve been waiting on this podcast to get me there, it’s the Once and Future Nerd, again wherever you find your podcasts. Or on Twitto, Tumbo, or Facebo. I also want to tell you about Ghost Puncher. It’s a webcomic but it also has a companion piece, D&D storytelling podcast called Ghost Puncher Corps. You can find it at GhostPuncher.net. Here’s what they have to say, Ghost Puncher and Ghost Puncher Corps— Corps? C-O-R-P-S. I’ve never been entirely sure how to pronounce that word but I’m gonna say corps— are super natural adventurers, tasked by Lucifer herself to keep order between the living and the dead. A few things you may find in the Ghost Puncher universe. Violence, nudity, body horror, dirty jokes, swear words, demonic shape shifting truck nuts? Okay, wasn’t expecting that. Good but nevertheless suspicious pecan Sandies, Big Billy’s potato product, werewolf pro wrestlers, a society of mutant subterranean jack rabbits, crunchy riffs, sexy synths, and a whole bunch of hopelessly gay ladies. That is Ghost Puncher, and Ghost Puncher Corps, and you can find that at GhostPuncher.net. Thank you to everybody who’s been tweeting about the show using the ""thezonecast"" hashtag, I sure do appreciate you spreading the word about the podcast, and about Amnesty, and about all the stuff we do here on the show. If you have a friend who you think might be into the shit we sling, then go ahead and just send them our way, And that’s cool when and if you do that. Wanna tell you, we have a project we’ve been working on with the Mysterious Package Company, it is a direct mail adventure, that we will send you on in Taako’s Correspondence School of Magics and Cantrips and Other Stuffs. It’s pretty cool, I’ve used the Mysterious Package Company stuff before and they’re just neat little mysteries delivered to you in the mail, that you, y’know, solve puzzles, and do activities, and there’s a narrative component. You get some like, physical rewards for doing it. We’re really excited about this project and you can find out more at mysteriouspackage.com and look for the link for Taako’s Correspondence School of Wizardry, Cantrips, & other Magicks. Also we got a comic book, or rather a graphic novel. That’s what you call them I guess when you want them to sound like, cool, and big, and smart. It is a graphic novel, you can find out more about that. It is an adaptation of the first arc of balance, Here There be Gerblins, and it’s coming out this Summer and you can preorder it right now at theadventurezonecomic.com. I wanna thank Max Fun for having us on the network, you can go to maximumfun.org and check out all the great shows there, and if you want to hear more stuff that we do you can go to McElroyshows.com and I think that is gonna do it. Again, we will be back in two weeks with the Adventure Zone Amnesty on May 31st, so I’ll talk to you then, bye. "

616,Dallas Live Show,{{53,03}}
617,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, so! Act two, begin! Hurley slams on the gas, narrowly avoiding another salvo from the enormous bomber overhead. You hear a loud clanking and whirring from the plane as it reloads for another assault. And, as if to run distraction for its companions, the smallest of the three vehicles— the wooden skimmer armed with a huge crossbow on its underside— flies down to hover just above your battlewagon. Its pilot flips some switches from its exposed cockpit and the crossbow readies a shot. It’s actually the skimmer’s turn in the order, and I think— "
618,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [softly] Damn!
619,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," —it launches a HUGE bolt right at Magnus, who is positioned on the trunk of the vehicle, Death Proof-style."
620,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Luckily, he’s got that magic shield that Dad made him."
621,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
622,Dallas Live Show,Travis," You didn’t. The joke is you didn’t, you protected the magic-user—"
623,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Twenty-four versus AC?
624,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Oh, Taako’s the other one!"
625,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Hold on, hold on!"
626,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, There’s no way you have fucking airplane proficiency! Those don’t exist!
627,Dallas Live Show,Travis," No, I know that. I’m looking to see what Fletcher’s Mitt does, cause I can’t remember."
628,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh, yeah…"
629,Dallas Live Show,Clint, It catches arrows!
630,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And it gives you plus one AC to projectiles, and if you block it, you catch the missile."
631,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And then I also have the Giant’s Ring, and I assume — cause you said it was a giant crossbow."
632,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [nervously] Okay…
633,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I— have I fought against crossbows before? I have, 'cause of Killian."
634,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
635,Dallas Live Show,Travis," So yes, actually—"
636,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," That makes 24— okay… [audience cheers] This fucking crossbow-wielding anti-infantry vehicle shoots a giant crossbow bolt at you, and you just— WHONK! [audience laughs and cheers] You whonk it, and— "
637,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [laughing] And I throw it back!
638,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It is your turn…
639,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And I throw it back! [audience laughs] No, I— well, I’m gonna hold onto it and I’m gonna grappling-hook-swing up into it."
640,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Your grappling hook?
641,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
642,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, You have one of those...
643,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Yes I do.
644,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay…
645,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I can use it once per day, I’m remembering all my items!"
646,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh— [audience cheers] any hot deets in there, or…"
647,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, I’m sure there are [laughs] things… yes, grappling hook, good for one use per day to climb something like Batman."
648,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [incredulously] That’s the end of it, what the fuck!"
649,Dallas Live Show,Travis, That’s what it says in the wiki!
650,Dallas Live Show,[Audience laughs],
651,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Good ol’ wiki!
652,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [mockingly] “I just feel like the world of Balance was so much more fleshed out…” [laughs]
653,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Well it went for 12 years!
654,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, uh, alright! You do that! You — Peew! Zip! Zing! Whoa! Aw man!"
655,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Now I would like to use my vehicle proficiency to try to take over the vehicle.
656,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
657,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, it’s an open cockpit, right. I'm thinking like a biplane, right? Like sort of an old-timey biplane with a crossbow mounted underneath, however, there is somebody in there, so it’s not— you’re not rolling against the airplane, like, “I’m doing the Airplane Takeover Roll!” You’re gonna have to do something about the person in the pilot seat."
658,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay, okay—"
659,Dallas Live Show,Justin,  Why does— I’ve always wondered— why does Travis get to do so many things every time?
660,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Why do you get to summon horses and dinosaurs and shit?
661,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," The uh, the—"
662,Dallas Live Show,[audience member yells out “GARYL!”],
663,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I know his name is Garyl, I’m on the show!"
664,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I thought it was Garyl.
665,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," The grappling hook was a move action, this is your action-action."
666,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And I get six of those!
667,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, yes."
668,Dallas Live Show,[Clint laughs],
669,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Okay, I’m going to— I don’t know— stab him!"
670,Dallas Live Show,[Audience laughs],
671,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, With the bolt…?
672,Dallas Live Show,Travis," With what? I don’t know, I’ve got so much!"
673,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Well then fucking pick something!
674,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I’m going to— I don’t know— feels like a sneak attack, doesn’t it? I’m going to—"
675,Dallas Live Show,[Justin and Clint laugh],
676,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Uh...
677,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Very sneaky!
678,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I’m gonna chop his head off with Railsplitter, fuck off!"
679,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
680,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay. Roll it. Roll that bean footage.
681,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yeah, good luck, harness."
682,Dallas Live Show,Travis, That’s a 26.
683,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [sarcastically] Yeah, that just hits."
684,Dallas Live Show,[Audience laughs],
685,Dallas Live Show,Clint, And it does not cut his head off fatally.
686,Dallas Live Show,Travis," No, that is an eight plus five— thirteen."
687,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, with a thirteen, you get into that neck meat, but he kinda flexes like,"
688,Dallas Live Show,Pilot, Hrrgh! Hrrragh!
689,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And the head does not come off.
690,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I come at it for a second time.
691,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," He laughs after the first attack, like,"
692,Dallas Live Show,        Pilot, Ha ha! Now it’s my tu— what?
693,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Uh, seventeen."
694,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yes."
695,Dallas Live Show,Travis, That is ten points of damage.
696,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It’s just on there with sinew and thread, and he’s like,"
697,Dallas Live Show,        Pilot, Ha ha ha! Now it’s time for my turn!
698,Dallas Live Show,Travis," I action— uh, action surge. [audience laughs] Nineteen."
699,Dallas Live Show,[Clint laughs],
700,Dallas Live Show,Travis," That’s, uh, thirteen again."
701,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
702,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [sing-song voice] I do one thing and I do it good!
703,Dallas Live Show,Clint, And over and over again!
704,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," His head... comes off. And, he’s like"
705,Dallas Live Show,        Pilot," Ha ha, I go— oh!"
706,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And it starts to, like, slide off his neck, he’s like"
707,Dallas Live Show,Pilot," Aww, shoot."
708,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," But... still alive, he’s also wearing a harness, so he’s good to go."
709,Dallas Live Show,Justin," These are good— can we keep these harnesses, they are very good!"
710,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," No, they only work… today. And, [audience laughs] uh, and I think his whole body, I think the — oh, here’s what happens — the plane starts to tilt, and his whole body just slumps out, and it also gets run over by Hurley’s battlewagon, but he’s still, like"
711,Dallas Live Show,        Pilot, [painfully] Oookaaay…
712,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the plane is starting to roll a little bit, there is still a tether, I think — well, no, I guess it was just a grappling hook, so it’s just you in the plane. Um…"
713,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [softly] It’s mine now.
714,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Is it— you’re in it? Okay, you’re in it, I’m not gonna do like a “you have to save the plane,” I think— "
715,Dallas Live Show,Travis, It’s my fucking plane now.
716,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, you have a plane now. Ha ha ha. Now I have a plane."
717,Dallas Live Show,[Travis laughs],
718,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, you did some cool stuff there. Merle, it is your turn. You got two more planes— and these planes are high above. They are pretty— pretty high up there, like… seventy feet? Does that feel good to everybody?"
719,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Wow. That’s really— okay.
720,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Heh heh, does that seem high to you, or...?"
721,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, A hundred feet? How high is high? Let’s say a hundred and twenty feet.
722,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Okay. So they’re up there. I cast Control Weather!
723,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," What do you do with the weather? Hold on, wait—"
724,Dallas Live Show,Clint," You can— wait, I gotta revel in this!— you take control of the weather within five miles!"
725,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
726,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Fuck!
727,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Wait, what the fuck? Hold on!"
728,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Read it and weep, loser!"
729,Dallas Live Show,Justin," It’s, watch, right now I’m calling it—"
730,Dallas Live Show,Travis," This is a Level 8 spell, are you—"
731,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Yes, I know it’s a Level 8— Oh my god, where were they?"
732,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
733,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Where were they?
734,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Oh— Dad has his glasses back.
735,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Dad has his glasses.
736,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It’s Level 8, but because—"
737,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Holy shit, look at all of you!"
738,Dallas Live Show,[Audience cheers],
739,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Wo-o-o-ow! I just thought it was, like, 8 people making a lot of noise."
740,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [sarcastically] Play some D&D with your dad. Have some laughs.
741,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, All right—
742,Dallas Live Show,Clint," You change the current weather conditions, you can change precipitation, temperature, and wind, so I’m gonna attack the— what’s the most rickety—"
743,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, this would not be an attack. You can do something and I’ll help you resolve it into something cool, but you’re not rolling, like, an attack."
744,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Okay. I want there to be… baseball-sized hailstones—
745,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, that’s a little TOO real, cuz Dallas is…"
746,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Softball-sized.
747,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Let’s, how ‘bout this, some people come here as an escape from the baseball-sized hailstones, so why don’t we—"
748,Dallas Live Show,Clint," How about this, how about if they’re coated with ice, all of them, which means they can’t fly as high-"
749,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Stop, okay—"
750,Dallas Live Show,Clint, And get ‘em within range of us.
751,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, it is a sleet storm, and because of this, uh, they are gonna have disadvantage on their, sort of, plane-based actions while they are in the sleet storm. You have de-buffed them permanently. You didn’t crash both fucking planes in the sky, with the one spell you shouldn’t be able to cast—"
752,Dallas Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] That’s all right! Still, sounds pretty damn competent to me."
753,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Sure does. 
754,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [to audience] What do you think?
755,Dallas Live Show,[Audience cheers],
756,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Thank you.
757,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Taako, you’re up."
758,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
759,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I also think they come down now, now they’re… 60 feet above you. "
760,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Eh—
761,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Does that still feel high?
762,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Still kinda high— how high is 60 feet? I’m trying to think of a 60-foot-tall dude, and that’s like, pretty tall, yeah? Yeah!"
763,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Wait, they’re 60 feet now?"
764,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, they came down."
765,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Or like twelve 5-foot-tall people.
766,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Now they’re 60 feet. [tongue pop] I’m gonna cast Mordekainen’s Sword.
767,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Yea-a-a-a-h!
768,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Uh, you see Taako extend his hand, and a big sword comes out of it. [Clint laughs] It is a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration. Um, and I’m gonna make a melee spell attack against a target of my choice."
769,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You got the dragon, and then you got the big bomber, the big metallic bomber, or sort of the more canvas-y—"
770,Dallas Live Show,Justin," They’ve got disadvantage, yeah?"
771,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Uh… yeah. On their saves and stuff.
772,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Perfect. 
773,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Thanks to Merle.
774,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Thanks to Merle, and his great— oh my god that’s a natural 20!"
775,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Ohhhh!
776,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
777,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Now, for those of you who are listening, his— his thing lit up. "
778,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," That’s true. Yo, we’ve got 20 minutes left we’re supposed to do, you can’t keep insta-killing these planes!"
779,Dallas Live Show,Justin," It’s— this is not gonna insta-kill it, Griffin. It’s just 3d10 force."
780,Dallas Live Show,[Clint and audience laughs],
781,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Well, is it x2 on a crit spell? Yeah, so that’s gonna be 6d10. We gonna do this manually?"
782,Dallas Live Show,Justin, 8. 7. 
783,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, 15...
784,Dallas Live Show,Travis, 19.
785,Dallas Live Show,Justin, 19 times 2?
786,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
787,Dallas Live Show,Justin and Travis, 38.
788,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay. Yes, okay, okay. And this was on the dragon?"
789,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Yeah. 
790,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, and what’s it look like? Describe it with your words. "
791,Dallas Live Show,Justin," It’s, uh…"
792,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You did TAZ Elementary, I know you know how to paint a picture."
793,Dallas Live Show,[Audience cheers],
794,Dallas Live Show,Justin," So it’s, uh, it’s— you just wanted to drink some water— [Griffin Yup.] it’s a sword... if you’ve ever seen…"
795,Dallas Live Show,Clint, A sword. 
796,Dallas Live Show,Justin, If you’ve ever seen—
797,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," A Game of Throne, they have, like, everyone’s got em."
798,Dallas Live Show,Justin, You know how on Thundercats?
799,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
800,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Ooh.
801,Dallas Live Show,Justin, It looks like the Sword of Omens. ‘Cuz… they just got Thundercats in this world. And everyone’s really into it.
802,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Shit, they—"
803,Dallas Live Show,Travis, They just got there.
804,Dallas Live Show,Justin," They just got it, and everybody’s super into it."
805,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, So slash or stab?
806,Dallas Live Show,Justin," It’s a wall of force, so it, it sort of slashes… through, I guess?"
807,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, I like that. Uh, all right, I think you—"
808,Dallas Live Show,Justin," It’s force damage, so it’s like—"
809,Dallas Live Show,Travis," You know, if someone hit you with, like, the flat of the blade, just like [impact noise] ow!"
810,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Yeah, it’s basically a spank, a spanking spell."
811,Dallas Live Show,[Audience laughs],
812,Dallas Live Show,Justin," A spanking sword, if you will."
813,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," All right, you hurt this dragon real bad, and with that, it flies down towards you, and it swoops in to sort of intercept you and protect the bomber. And as you eyeball it, you realize that this vehicle has no pilot. It is being controlled remotely somewhere by somebody very skilled."
814,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Asshole.
815,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
816,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," With a flap of what remains of its wings, it pulls ahead and turns to face you, and it has streaks of flame beginning to grow in its mouth. Taako, uh, [to himself] Jesus Christ. And it has disadvantage. Okay, first time I rolled a three. The second time, I swear to Christ, I rolled a one. "
817,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
818,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [sarcastically] Let me check my sheet, hold on."
819,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Ohh.
820,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, so. It tries to bite at you, and right as it does—"
821,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And its fucking butt falls off?
822,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Its jaw, its jaw is like— [creaking squawks], and its jaw just falls completely off, because of the cool slash that you did earlier. Then, with its second attack, uh, that fire—"
823,Dallas Live Show,Travis,"  Wait, it gets more than one attack?"
824,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, imagine that. Its fire, now unimpeded by a second lower jaw shoots out—"
825,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [laughs] Its true form has been realized!
826,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, —at your vehicle. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw. 
827,Dallas Live Show,Travis, But I’m not on the…
828,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oh, you’re right. Magnus is good. Actually, no, it’s shooting at all of them. You are saving for the plane. "
829,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Nineteen plus three, 22?"
830,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Good.
831,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I got a twelve. [about Clint] That is a nat 20.
832,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, but it is, that is just a save."
833,Dallas Live Show,[Audience cheers],
834,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You very save, you extremely save. Uh, Magnus, the fire just gets—"
835,Dallas Live Show,[Audience oohs],
836,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, now Dad just knocked a bottle of water off the table and grabbed it. Tonight—"
837,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I’m on FIRE!
838,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, You are killing it. Okay.
839,Dallas Live Show,Clint, I am ON FIRE. 
840,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, take—"
841,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I’m gonna miss him so much.
842,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, take 32 points of fire damage."
843,Dallas Live Show,Travis, All right.
844,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And also, the left wing of your airplane is on fire. "
845,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Cool.
846,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Still flying, on fire, going to be a situation."
847,Dallas Live Show,Travis, All right.
848,Dallas Live Show,Clint," You have a harness, Trav."
849,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, You are next.
850,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And now I’m down to only 99 hitpoints. 
851,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
852,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You are next, Magnus. Don’t fucking lower the stakes for them, they don’t know how many fucking hitpoints you have! "
853,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I do! It’s on my sheet!
854,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," No, they don’t! I say 36, they’re like “What if he has thirty seven?” "
855,Dallas Live Show,Travis," [laughs] Okay, so my plane is a little on fire, do I— can I control the giant crossbow?"
856,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, hm. That’s a good question. Actually, because you’re in the middle of a hailstorm, you can but you’ll have disadvantage. Hoo-o-o-o!"
857,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Good job, Dad."
858,Dallas Live Show,Travis, How close am I to the bomber?
859,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, it’s still way up in the sky, it’s a hundred and twenty feet. [recording skip, missing info, probably something along the lines of Travis saying that he wants to fly the skimmer into the dragon] Uh, you could, but you’re going to have to roll really good to fly through this sleet storm—"
860,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Well, I pull out my Stone of Farspeech [makes clicking noise]—"
861,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," [slightly muffled, like talking into a two-way radio][a] Uh, yeah, uhhhhhhh..."
862,Dallas Live Show,[Griffin laughs],
863,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, [radio effect] Taako? Uhh…
864,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [mockingly, with the same “radio” effect] Come on back here, buddy."
865,Dallas Live Show,Magnus," Yeah, uh, do you have any plans for the, uhhhhhhhhhh— "
866,Dallas Live Show,"[Audience laughs. All continue talking with the ""radio"" effect.]",
867,Dallas Live Show,???," [radio effect] 10-4, back door."
868,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, —the dragon?
869,Dallas Live Show,Justin, What?
870,Dallas Live Show,Griffin [possibly voicing an NPC?]," Hey, sorry, this is [Ger? Jerr?]—"
871,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Yeah?
872,Dallas Live Show,Griffin [same possibly npc voice], Can you say that again? You sound wild—
873,Dallas Live Show,Justin,"  You fucking, like, microphones work by putting your voice in them, like—"
874,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [radio effect] Uhhhhhhhhhhh… 
875,Dallas Live Show,Justin, —that’s how I hear you.
876,Dallas Live Show,Clint," [radio effect] Did you, did you want a large fries with that?"
877,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
878,Dallas Live Show,Justin, This is hell!
879,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [still doing the radio effect] —an orange drink. Do you want an orange drink?
880,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Are you trying to get the person controlling the dragon to—
881,Dallas Live Show,Travis," No, I was trying ask Taako what the deal was with the dragon but I’m just going to crash my plane into the dragon."
882,Dallas Live Show,[Justin laughs],
883,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [a bit incredulous] Okay.
884,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Don’t worry, I’m gonna leap to safety."
885,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
886,Dallas Live Show,Clint, In your harness.
887,Dallas Live Show,Travis," In— no, to the battlewagon."
888,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And that’s a natural 20.
889,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Nat 20! Man!
890,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
891,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Juice, can you get a picture of that?"
892,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think the first thing you see, everybody else in the car, battlewagon, shit. I think all you see— should I wait until after you’re taking  a picture in the middle of the podcast that we’re doing or… "
893,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Just a momento, we’re sharing time as a family together."
894,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You’re on that table, I don’t get the family time! I have my own family over here on my solo table with my fucking wizard sheet."
895,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
896,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think, Taako and Merle, you see, through the windshield of the car, you see Magnus just land on the windshield, on the, uh, trunk, just like “Hey, ‘sup?” and then you see his plane, like, a second later just crash into the dragon and explode. And now, uh, both are downed, and—"
897,Dallas Live Show,Travis," And Creed starts to play in the background. Don’t ask why, it just does."
898,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and with that, uh, the—"
899,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And also he lowers his aviators. Or puts them on? What’s cooler? [pause] Puts them on. Puts them on.
900,Dallas Live Show,[Clint laughs],
901,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," The bomber overhead readies another salvo of bombs, this time it’s like smaller cluster bombs that you have to dodge out of the way of on the car, and I know that doesn’t make a lot of sense if you think about it, but everyone make a dexterity saving throw. "
902,Dallas Live Show,"[Indistinguishable audience shout, supposedly about Griffin saying car]",
903,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Uh, eighteen."
904,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Battlewagon, not car, sorry, thank you."
905,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Uh… 
906,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, But please don’t yell things at the stage.
907,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Uh, two."
908,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Two is bad.
909,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Seventeen, plus one, eighteen."
910,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, okay."
911,Dallas Live Show,Justin," You’re a dextrous motherfucker tonight, man!"
912,Dallas Live Show,??, [snorts]
913,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, Taako, you get hit by these very small bombs that [breaks into laughter] don’t hit anybody else."
914,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
915,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Eyy.
916,Dallas Live Show,Clint, They’re smart bombs.
917,Dallas Live Show,Travis," But you do have that extra AC, does that help?"
918,Dallas Live Show,Justin, That does help!
919,Dallas Live Show,[Clint cackles triumphantly],
920,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It doesn’t, it was a saving throw, it doesn’t help, it doesn’t help."
921,Dallas Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] But I rolled a two, so it doesn’t help at all."
922,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Aw.
923,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, It’s just 11 points of damage.
924,Dallas Live Show,Justin, How many?
925,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Eleven.
926,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Alright.
927,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, here’s what happens. Taako, did I tell you how much damage you would take? Yes, did that. Uh, I think the bomber overhead starts to ready another salvo, and you hear Hurley, she’s got her own Stone of Farspeech— Carspeech? If it was a car, that would be good. "
928,Dallas Live Show,Travis, There’s something there.
929,Dallas Live Show,Clint," That’s the show with the two brothers, right?"
930,Dallas Live Show,Justin, It’s her Stone of Battlewagon-speech. 
931,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It’s her Stone of Battlewagon-speech, and she pulls it out and says, um."
932,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Hey, babe, can you do the thing?"
933,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And then we see Sloane, in the press box, kinda sigh. And then the wood that composes her body, she, like, claps her hands together and it starts to glow, and then from the ground immediately in front of your battlewagon, roots start to grow up to form a sick ramp."
934,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
935,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And right when your car is about to hit it, Hurley flips up a latch on the stick shift and presses a button, and the horns on the ram on the front of the car turn backwards and ignite, sweet NOS. And your wagon goes flying upward into the air in the direction of the bomber. "
936,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Autobots, transform!"
937,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And it sails over the wing of the bomber, and Hurley says—"
938,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Get out, get out, get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out!"
939,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Okay.
940,Dallas Live Show,Travis, And Magnus does.
941,Dallas Live Show,Justin," I get out, I guess… "
942,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay—
943,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Sure.
944,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," —and you land on the wing of the bomber for the climactic boss fight! And her car keeps on going over the wing, and you see her inside like—"
945,Dallas Live Show,Hurley," Uh oh, shit!"
946,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," —and she goes sailing back towards the ground. But she’s fine, ‘cause she has the magic harness. "
947,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
948,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You actually see her jump out and her bubble deploys and she falls safely, but her car explodes as it hits the ground. "
949,Dallas Live Show,[audience groans],
950,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, But she’s cool.
951,Dallas Live Show,Travis, She’s fine.
952,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And now you are on the wing of the bomber, and you land, and see where I am in the notes."
953,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hmm.
954,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," You’re on the wings of the bomber, which have a span of nearly twenty feet, equipped with four propellers that drag the vessel through the sky. On the front of the plane you see a cockpit hatch protruding, heavily reinforced by the look of it, and inside you see the dwarf you encountered earlier, Alfred D’Gaul, piloting the vessel. He doesn’t seem to have noticed that you’re there—"
955,Dallas Live Show,Travis, He’s a halfling.
956,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Was he? 
957,Dallas Live Show,Justin," He’s a halfling, yeah."
958,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [to audience] Was he?
959,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers in agreement] ,
960,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Oooh-kay! 
961,Dallas Live Show,[Travis laughs],
962,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Oops! You see the halfling, and it’s Alfred D’Gaul, and he doesn’t notice you’re there, but his mobility behind him is limited and he’s trying to contact his companions, but to no avail. What do you do? [pause] We are out of initiative."
963,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Uh, is he in the race?"
964,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the race has kinda sorta become a little confusing at this point. "
965,Dallas Live Show,Justin, [dejected] I really did want to win the race. [pause] Do you feel like we won?
966,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
967,Dallas Live Show,Clint, There is a lot of money at stake.
968,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
969,Dallas Live Show,Clint, You said a hundred thousand gold.
970,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [a bit sarcastically] Twenty million gold, yeah."
971,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
972,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I never thought the three of you, sneaking up on an unarmed unaware enemy, would lead to such fucking pause. "
973,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Death Ward!
974,Dallas Live Show,Justin, What?
975,Dallas Live Show,Clint," Well, you’re just sitting there on your ass, not doing anything!"
976,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Somebody, do something, what’s going on?!"
977,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Dad cast a weird spell, so tell us all about it, Mac."
978,Dallas Live Show,Clint,"  Well, the first time [crosstalk] you—"
979,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Yeah? [crosstalk] Cast it? Is now.
980,Dallas Live Show,Clint," —the target would drop to zero hitpoints as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to one hitpoint and the spell ends."
981,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Are you protecting him?
982,Dallas Live Show,Clint, What I’m—
983,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Here’s the thing, I was going to stab him, and then Dad was like “I’m gonna kill him with a spell!” but the spell saves his life."
984,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Dad cast a healing spell on him, so again, I’m going to ask. Everything okay over at that table? Y’all having family discussions over on that table so I don’t know if there’s some sort of drama going on, I don’t know if you all got stung with the same bee, and it’s making your brains not work anymore."
985,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Maybe Merle’s going through his canon spell cards. And Magnus just goes “Hold on,” and just stabs the dude."
986,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay—
987,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Do I have to do anything to make this spell happen? Don’t I have to roll?
988,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [laughs] We have not played Dungeons & Dragons in so fucking long!
989,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Here!
990,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Your spell—
991,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, [sounding panicked and exasperated] What are you rolling to do?! 
992,Dallas Live Show,[audience & Justin laugh],
993,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," [in the same frantic tone] The fucking cockpit opens up, he— [struggles for words] it’s been eight minutes! He fucking looks behind him. “How long have you been there?” “Eight minutes.” He gets out of the cockpit—"
994,Dallas Live Show,[Justin laughs],
995,Dallas Live Show,Travis," A, a 24 versus AC for a sneak attack?"
996,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," He steps out— nope it’s too late— you reach back to attack but he’s been standing there for five minutes, ‘cause you’ve been standing there for eighteen minutes doing fucking nothing! "
997,Dallas Live Show,[Justin breaks down again],
998,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," There’s a million people here! No, Alfred gets out, and he says, uh—"
999,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," I see you’ve taken out my companions, but you don’t seem to get it. I already won. Your race won’t be finished, the fans will be upset, and the next time they want to go out for some entertainment, what are they gonna think about? These big, cool skywagons dogfighting in the clouds! You should have taken my off— well, I guess you did take my offer, but you should have followed through with my offer, fellas."
1000,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Here’s what you don’t know. I bet your ten thousand gold on this exact outcome. And then I’m gonna use that money to buy the Blazing Wings! It was a million to one odds that this exact outcome would play out. It is also the plot of Dodgeball. 
1001,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, I love that flick. Fantasy Ben Stiller.
1002,Dallas Live Show,Taako," So what is it about, what is it about Blazing Wings, the planes that explode, you think is going to drive in the crowds?"
1003,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, Folks love cool plane stunts
1004,Dallas Live Show,Taako," [crosstalk] Damn, you’re right, okay, as soon as I said it I realized."
1005,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," Yeah, did you hear what you said? "
1006,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Yeah, it’s very cool."
1007,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," And that’s why I think, listen, the whole Blaze Wings thing is pretty dope, if you really think about what they are."
1008,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Yeah, it’s very good."
1009,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, So anyways—
1010,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, It’s a real challenge.
1011,Dallas Live Show,Alfred, —I’ve foiled everything and I guess—
1012,Dallas Live Show,Taako," Wait! There’s one thing that, um, could foil you. What if somebody won the race? "
1013,Dallas Live Show,Alfred," There’s no way, it’s done—"
1014,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And Taako jumps out of the plane. 
1015,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
1016,Dallas Live Show,Justin," And on the way down to the ground, he casts Phantom Steed!"
1017,Dallas Live Show,[cheers grow louder],
1018,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," What’s, uh, what’s the suspension like on those binicorn legs? "
1019,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Um, it’s pretty good, considering that I have an umbrella that always has Feather Fall that I can cast for free."
1020,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
1021,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Do you still have that?
1022,Dallas Live Show,Travis, They crafted another one in the last six months.
1023,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, fine. "
1024,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Thank you.
1025,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, So let’s finish the plane business first as you are sailing towards the ground.
1026,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Yes.
1027,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Magnus and Merle, what do you do?"
1028,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Yes!
1029,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Are you going to let Taako win the race?
1030,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
1031,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Okay. That’s very big of you.
1032,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, I bet on this exact outcome!
1033,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, okay. Okay, I think, D’Gaul runs back towards the cockpit—"
1034,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I throw the Chance Lance.
1035,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay. No, it’s gone, he’s not going to bring it out now, Paul’s got other jobs to do other than run out here and brings us cups of pencils and spears and things. "
1036,Dallas Live Show,Travis, It’s a 25.
1037,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
1038,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Wait, you rolled a 25?"
1039,Dallas Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
1040,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Man.
1041,Dallas Live Show,Clint, That sounds like one of my rolls.
1042,Dallas Live Show,[audience laughs],
1043,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Uh, six?"
1044,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, not great, However—"
1045,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Chance Lance is a little rusty from disuse, it seems."
1046,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," It hits him, and he kind of steps backwards, and he’s like [chuckles], and then as you recall it out of him, he sort of overcompensates his step and he goes backwards into one of the propellers. Um. [audience cheers] But! [laughs] As his particles fly through the air, they sort of give a thumbs-up. [audience cheers] “I’m good.” And then that propeller explodes. And then he’s still pretty good. But now the plane you’re standing on is starting to go down."
1047,Dallas Live Show,Magnus, Eh.
1048,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And this is how they die!
1049,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I’ve got a harness!
1050,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Okay, you just fucking ride it, fucking ride it to the ground?"
1051,Dallas Live Show,Travis," Yeah, fuck it."
1052,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah!
1053,Dallas Live Show,Travis, I hug Merle one last time. 
1054,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," So you’re just Thelma-and-Louise-ing it? Okay. Yeah. You both go down together. Here’s the scene. Taako, you hit the ground with Garyl, and you’re just cool."
1055,Dallas Live Show,Garyl," What’s up, we racing?"
1056,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think the audience is kinda confused about what’s happening, they're not really sure what they just watched, they thought—"
1057,Dallas Live Show,Justin, This audience? Or—
1058,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, This audience.
1059,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Okay.
1060,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," They’re not really sure what they watched, they thought it was going to be a race, and then some planes from some competing leagues started to show up, and then tried to blow everything up. But you hear some yelling from the sidelines, the other racers realize what’s going on, and they’re all pointing to the finish line, which is right in front of you. "
1061,Dallas Live Show,Justin," I tell Garyl, “If you go fast tonight, I’ll give you some oats.” [b]I whisper in his ear [crosstalk] and he’s like—"
1062,Dallas Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Ghosty oats.
1063,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And he’s like—
1064,Dallas Live Show,Garyl, Spectral oats? 
1065,Dallas Live Show,Justin, And I’m like—
1066,Dallas Live Show,Taako, You know it.
1067,Dallas Live Show,Justin," And then he goes faster, than the other… people? I don’t know if we’re racing, I can just say he’s faster than the other ones and he wins the race?"
1068,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," I think, as you’re running down the track, there are no other battlewagons—"
1069,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Oh, yeah!"
1070,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," —which means the audience has been down on the racetrack level for a few minutes, the thirty minutes you spent up there not doing anything—"
1071,Dallas Live Show,Justin," Then Taako stands up in the stirrups and raises his hands, like hey, this is the show."
1072,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And now the audience is losing it.
1073,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Racing is still alive!
1074,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, The audience—
1075,Dallas Live Show,Justin," He casts Prismatic Spray, and like, colors shooting out of his hands, it’s an amazing spectacle! This is what racing is all about! "
1076,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And right as you cross the finish line, the bomber crashes to the ground behind you— "
1077,Dallas Live Show,[Justin laughs triumphantly],
1078,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, —in a massive explosion. 
1079,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah!
1080,Dallas Live Show,[audience cheers],
1081,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And confetti shoots up from the pylons, and Hurley and Sloane run towards you with the Turbo Platinum Cup, and all the other racers run out, cheering. You saved their league and put on an amazing show."
1082,Dallas Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] And Merle— Merle and Magnus are totally fine.
1083,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," And Merle and Magnus, from the flaming wreckage— do you look back to see if your friends are okay?"
1084,Dallas Live Show,Justin, I don’t.
1085,Dallas Live Show,Clint, No.
1086,Dallas Live Show,[Griffin laughs],
1087,Dallas Live Show,Clint, Noooo.
1088,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Well, for whoever is looking, from the flaming wreckage, we see the hands of Merle and Magnus stick out two big, gross thumbs up. "
1089,Dallas Live Show,Justin," But Taako didn’t see that, because he didn’t look—"
1090,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," No, he’s totally good."
1091,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Okay.
1092,Dallas Live Show,Griffin, And that’s the episode!
1093,Dallas Live Show,Justin, Hey folks! 
1094,Dallas Live Show,Griffin," Thank you all so much for coming! Uh, we’ll see whoever’s gonna be here tomorrow for MBMBAM, and... Bye!"

1096,Dallas Live Show,"[a]its kind of a tone of voice not unlike talking into a radio and pretty much everyone does it for the next two minutes, not sure how to note that",
1097,Dallas Live Show,"[b]not in character voice, so not sure if i should indent this?",
