6,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,(part of TAZscripts on Tumblr) ,
7,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy, your Dungeon Master, your best friend, and... a third thing that I will think of, later, at the commercial break. "
8,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, thank you all for listening to The Adventure Zone, this is gonna be a special episode because uh Travis and Teresa had a baby and we are so happy for them! Teresa and the baby are both doing very well, um, and so what you’re about to hear is one of three episodes that we have ready for our sort of... group paternal leave, because my wife Rachel and I, we’re expecting a baby also in early December. "
9,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So we are going to put out this episode now, I’m so excited for you to hear it, it is our Boston live show, uh, that we did at the Wilbur Theater. It was a sold out crowd, and it was one of the best nights of my whole life. Everybody there was so, so so spectacular and I was really happy with how the story turned out. My hope is that the next episode you hear, which is gonna go up on November 17th, will be the second episode in The Suffering Game arc that we just started. Man, that title is so…. It’s so brutal to say. But that is my hope. "
10,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then, uh, once I am also a papa, we will have two more episodes ready for you that I am also so excited to get to. But this just had to be the first one that we put out for this parental leave block, because I can’t not— you can’t not have heard it anymore. It’s too important. I think you’re really gonna enjoy it and like I said,  [theme music begins to fade in] the next episode should be a regular one if things calm down a bit and we have some time to put some play time on the books. But for now, enjoy the Boston Live Stunt Spectacular. "
11,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[THEME MUSIC," ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson (full song on YouTube) rises to full volume; a cheering crowd can be heard and overtakes the music almost entirely.]"
12,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You know we’re just gonna play Dungeons & Dragons, right?"
13,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[The boys laugh and the crowd laughs/screams.],
14,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Alright. You’ve heard the show, right?"
15,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You guys, um,"
16,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," That was the loudest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life. [crosstalk, the crowd laughs]"
17,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, these costumes are wonderful, and thank you boys for the hard work that went into them. I did— this is a fun story— just have to help Dad change into his costume backstage [the crowd laughs] which was a horrifying look into the future. [the crowd cheers and claps] There’s actually a small, a smaller person in there that’s controlling the arm for Dad, it’s like a—"
18,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Please be careful of Justin’s drink with your giant wooden hand, Dad."
19,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Oh my god.
20,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, If it touches me I’m burning this fucker down.
21,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Is there anyone here who has not ever listened to the show?
22,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Son of a bitch, stop it. (probably directed at Clint)"
23,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[a few isolated cheers from the crowd in response to Travis’s question],
24,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, You’re gonna be so confused! [crowd laughter]
25,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, time out. We need to take a vote. This is gonna be untenable. [crowd laughter]"
26,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, you’re gonna need to remo— oh can you even remove it, is it strapped underneath your cloak?"
27,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It’s strapped on underneath the clothes. [crowd laughter]
28,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, listen, while Dad deals with that—"
29,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So, um, there are a few people here who haven’t listened, we play Dungeons & Dragons, and well they play it, I run the game, do you guys wanna talk a little bit about your characters?"
30,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[crowd cheers],
31,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I thought that’s why we had the thing with the... [presumably this video or one like it was played at the venue.]
32,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that’s a good point."
33,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," The thing— My name is Justin McElroy, I play Taako, he— [interrupted by crowd cheering enthusiastically] Thank you. Thank you. It’s a collaborative creation. And uh, he’s a wizard, and, I dunno, he’s down for whatever. [crowd laughter] Well, unless it’s dangerous, in which case ‘Taako’s good out here.’ [crowd laughter]"
34,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And my name is Clint McElroy, and [crowd cheering] Are you just gonna keep interrupting with these outbursts?? [Griffin laughs, small cheer from the crowd] ‘Cause it’s cool! [crowd cheers] Yeah, do that!"
35,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, We’ve got all night.
36,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," We’ve got all night! I play, uh, Merle Highchurch [crowd cheers] who is a… Uh…"
37,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Cleric— [crowd laughs]
38,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, An elf…
39,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Nope! Nope.
40,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It’s funny, because it’s so true."
41,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Dwarf.
42,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yup.
43,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, He’s a dwarf…
44,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Don’t help him! [crowd laughs] He can— he has to do this on his own.
45,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," A pr— uh, uh, cleric— [small crowd cheers]"
46,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yup. He does clerical work.
47,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," He likes long walks on the beach,"
48,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, Travis, what do you do?"
49,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," And I am Travis McElroy, [crowd cheers] and I play Magnus Burnsides the fighter. [crowd cheer] He is—"
50,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, The Hammer!
51,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," The Hammer, he is known as The Hammer in some small circles. [crowd laugh] Um, he is a human,"
52,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, humanity! Yes, that’s us!"
53,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Anyone else here human?! [crowd cheer] Uh, he has a pet goldfish named Steven who is alive and well, [crowd cheer] uh, and he pulls robots’ arms off."
54,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Hey, let’s uh—"
55,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, That’s a hobby.
56,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Uh, would it be possible for us to get a little bit more monitor on the stage?"
57,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, I’m having a bit of a hard time hearing my— my family."
58,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," They real horny for this one and uh, it’s hard— [crowd cheers]"
59,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, They were way hornier than we anticipated.
60,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," So if we could hear ourselves a little bit louder that would be amazing, thank you."
61,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And that’s Griffin McElroy! 
62,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Hi! [crowd cheers] [in a dudebro voice] And I— I play the part of Douglas and he’s a gnome thief. Let’s get started.
63,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Hell yeah.
64,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah.
65,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Wait, can, Travis, can you hand me my assistant Courvoisier. "
66,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah.
67,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," And, uh, ginger ale?"
68,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Travis just brought a big box of beverages out here. [crowd cheers]
69,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, IT’S A PROP! It’s not real!
70,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that’s a magic podcast potion."
71,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s how the magic happens. [crowd laughs]
72,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, God.
73,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I’m gonna keep this down here so I don’t block line of sight cause we’re gonna do— if this is an indication of the level of, this Courvoisier is any indication, we’re about to do some connection, you and I."
74,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So uh, this is gonna be a little—"
75,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Lord!
76,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Oh yeah!
77,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Oh yeah, Travis, tell them what that is. [crowd cheering]"
78,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Isaac, your Love Boat bartender, ladies and gentlemen!"
79,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I don’t know if you can see, "
80,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Holy shit!
81,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, just make sure you build a wall so nobody can see you— "
82,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," And Dad’s got a Diet Coke. Can you show ‘em the one bottle, that Andy made—"
83,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh yeah, this is uh, from Columbia Brewing,"
84,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Andy, are you here, Andy?"
85,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," From Andy, this is the Burnsides Brew Smithery Magnus BurnCider. That was made for us for this show. [crowd cheering]"
86,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [laughs] Patent pending.
87,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It says it’s, uh, it says it’s an 18% alcohol content but really it’s just five."
88,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[Travis laughs uproariously, along with the crowd.]",
89,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Ha ha ha ha HA! That was really good!
90,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, That was funny!
91,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Oh yeah.
92,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," ‘Cause you fuckin’ cheat all the time. [crowd laughs] All right. So this is gonna be a sidequest, this is not in the current arc that we are currently exploring, and uh, let’s get going. "
93,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So Merle, Magnus and Taako, you all find yourselves in the bustling metropolis of Neverwinter. It’s early spring, I think this would probably come right after Crystal Kingdom, right before The Eleventh Hour which we’re in right now, so it’s early spring and I guess that means it was just late fall? ‘Cause they just skip winter entirely? Hi, Travis. Oh, thank you for the beverage. [crowd laughs] Um, and you’ve been summoned to Neverwinter by a letter you received a couple of weeks after the whole Crystal Kingdom debacle. And the letter was sent to you by a name that you recognized, but it was one that you hadn’t heard or really thought of in months."
94,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And it starts off, ‘Dear Casey,’..."
95,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Griffin laughs],
96,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Something we can— a reference we can all enjoy.
97,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, So topical!
98,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Six or seven got it.
99,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Where my sectagenarians at?!? [crowd cheering, laughing]"
100,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, the uh, the letter was actually sent to you by one Jess the Beheader."
101,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Ohhh. [crowd cheers]
102,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Who you befriended on the— let’s see if Dad can even, do you remember?"
103,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Oh yeah!
104,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Yes, I remember him. He uh, [crowd laughs]"
105,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, wrong. Uh, Jess the Beheader wrote you a letter. Oh, that’s fun. And says, "
106,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Couldn’t work out better.
107,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Great. Oh boy, this is gonna be a long night, folks."
108,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," This is top-notch humor. You’re not gonna get this rhyming jokes anywhere else. [Clint chuckles, the crowd laughs]"
109,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, The letter reads
110,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Dear Magnus, Tahcko(sp?),"
111,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And they put the little spelling symbol, like, maybe they spelled it wrong— they did."
112,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, “SP?”
113,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Dear Magnus, Tahcko(sp?), and... the other one. [audience laughter] How are you? I am fine. Wow, it’s nice to catch up like this. So, I need a favor. I need a big favor. You all really kicked ass on that Rockport Limited mystery and I could use your help solving another murder and if you’re feeling generous I could use some help preventing a second murder."
114,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Ehh..
115,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, The first murder was Brock Thickstone.
116,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [laughs] It was on a porn set! [all laugh]
117,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," The first was Brock Thickstone, my BattleFest partner, who was killed in cold blood after our Supreme Champion qualifiers last week. The second is me. It would be very cool to not get murdered. [audience laughs] Brock was killed in cold blood in the locker room here at Chaos Stadium, which is actually a really nice stadium, despite the name, and despite the fact that somebody was recently murdered here. "
118,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Justin and audience laugh] ,
119,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," His body was found holding a bouquet of flowers— he really liked flowers— that he had received just after our match the night of his death. Neverwinter’s justicars discovered the bouquet had been cursed by powerful magics, although, y’know, that stuff is kind of over my head. If you could come figure out who killed my dude, and keep me safe through the Supreme Champion finals, I’d be happy to split the big ol’ prize pool that comes along with the title. Oh, I guess I need a third favor too. I need a new partner in the ring. Magnus—"
120,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeaaahh!
121,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, —you ever tried your hand at prizefighting? 
122,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[the crowd cheers],
123,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeaaaahhh!!!!
124,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Best wishes, Jess. "
125,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then in parentheses, “the Beheader.”"
126,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’ll text her back.
127,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
128,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, her!"
129,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, U GOT IT smiley face… [crowd laughs]
130,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, So…
131,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Thumbs up…
132,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I guess you would correspond with— 
133,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Monorail. [audience laughs]
134,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, so the three of you took the first cannonball out of the Bureau of Balance headquarters and made a beeline for the Chaos Stadium, which is nestled in the northern outskirts of Neverwinter’s—"
135,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, So they’re okay with us just like using…
136,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah.
137,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," —Company resources like higgledy-piggledy? [audience laugh] Like, if we’re, like, late for a movie,"
138,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Cannonball me, baby!"
139,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Maybe it’s like that scene in Independence Day where Will Smith steals the helicopter and the guy’s like, “You can’t take the helicopter” and he’s like, “You really wanna shoot ME?” [beat] From Independence Day, you remember that scene? [audience laugh] Uh, I should mention that you shared that cannonball with a special guest, one specifically requested in Jess’s letter. “P.S.”, it reads, "
140,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," If you’re still in touch with him— just a thought, but could you bring the boy detective too?"
141,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," No, no!"
142,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, YAAAAAAY! [audience screams and claps]
143,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," No, no!"
144,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Ango!
145,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Come on! I hate the boy detective!
146,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, No you don’t.
147,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I hate him!
148,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Noo you don’t.
149,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," What is, uh, how is he reacting to the cannonball? [small audience laugh]"
150,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, he—"
151,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, do it in character."
152,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He was a champion.
153,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Of course he was.
154,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Do the voice.
155,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, well, right, that— we’re in medias res right now, but uh—"
156,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, I thought we were in Neverwinter. "
157,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Hey, hey. [audience laugh/groan/clap/boo]"
158,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Vocabulary joke!
159,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m drinking it in!
160,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, but, uh, uh, you do get a hearty,"
161,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus," Hello, sirs!"
162,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience screams] ,
163,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And standing in front of you in front of Chaos Stadium is Angus McDonald, who is a bit winded. The three of you managed to shake him in the busy crowds of the Protector’s Enclave, but he is the world’s greatest detective, so he managed to find you. [audience and Justin laugh]"
164,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, Sorry I lost track of you! I looked away for just a second and you were gone! [audience laugh]
165,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, If we kill anybody in this story does it hold for the rest of the—
166,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It would be a paradox.
167,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," We’re unkillable, though, right?"
168,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Essentially, yeah."
169,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, awesome."
170,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, YEAH!!!
171,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Should be good. NO REPERCUSSIONS!! [audience laugh]
172,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus," I’m glad that I managed to find you, I was worried that I was not gonna be included on this adventure."
173,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," (under his breath) Oh, shit."
174,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Despite our best fuckin’ efforts.
175,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I wanna point out that Justin did that in Justin voice, not Taako voice, so that’s not canon."
176,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Yeah.
177,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, you guys are being really sweet to Angus. Um."
178,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, For a change.
179,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I should also mention that today is Angus’s birthday. [audience cheers]
180,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Awwww.
181,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Which is probably how you were convinced to bring him along in the first place. You probably, like, tore off that part of the letter and were like ‘I dunno man, [Justin and audience laugh] she didn’t mention you, I’m sorry.’"
182,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I feel like Magnus got him something. Like maybe a carved wooden duck?
183,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"Griffin. Okay. [audience laugh] So maybe that’s, like, all you can actually make?",
184,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," It might just be what he’s really good at. It’s not like, limited, but he knows his strengths."
185,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Get him a carved wooden stag. That would be—
186,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I give him a carved wooden stag, sure."
187,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," [holding back laughter at his own goof] The little girl that got one on Game of Thrones, that worked out good for them. [Audience cries out/laughs/claps] That’s a different fantasy thing.."
188,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah… uh, so uh, the four of you are standing in front of Chaos Stadium, and the crowd is rambunctious. The, the BattleFest [some yelling from audience] Yeah, okay, a little bit of Foley work from the audience? [slightly more yelling] That was maybe the least rambunctious crowd I’ve ever heard? [audience laugh]"
189,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah. Oh, we didn’t pick a, we didn’t pick a scrivener."
190,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Oh, that’s right. We’ll be fine."
191,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Okay.
192,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Last time we did this, we’ve only done one live Adventure Zone by the way so there might be some rough edges—"
193,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, That’ll show you how good it was.
194,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, that was in front of 125 people who, frankly, didn’t seem to wanna be there very much. [audience laugh]"
195,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience member," [distant, very quiet] You always remember your first time!"
196,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that is true."
197,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It’s not a back and forth kind of thing.
198,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, it’s kind of a one— [audience cheers and claps]"
199,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s D&D but it’s not that interactive.
200,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yes.
201,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So, uh, the, the BattleFest Supreme Champion Finals are about to take place, and the scene I’m trying to set is Wrestlemania."
202,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Got it. [audience cheer]
203,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," That’s the picture I want you to lock in your mind. The crowd here is rambunctious, it seems like there’s far too many people here to fit into any one building, and every single person in the crowd seems as rowdy as any ten non-BattleFest-attendees combined. Everywhere you look are cosplayers— "
204,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience member, [audible] Yeah!
205,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, —dressed up in the spandex regalia of famous fighters. Some of those fighters are featured on those large banners which are draped across the walls of the building.
206,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"The building looks like a very old building that has been sort of repurposed for this? Like there are these tall stone columns, it looks very ancient, for lack of a better term. Uh, yeah, and people are cosplaying, there are some signs, so many signs. Jess’s name is all over the place, a third of the signs here say ‘Off with their heads!’ in big block letters, there’s, a few have an image of a crescent moon with the words ‘Unleash the Beast’ on them, some are for a fighter named Queen Sabine, and a few, mostly in the hands of some smaller kids, who are wearing angel wings, are championing a fighter named Jeff Angel [audience and Clint laugh], and then there are signs for like the die-hard BattleFest fans who you’ve probably never heard of before. Although I should ask you— the BattleFest franchise, which is the WWE, essentially, has been around in this world for about a decade or so.",
207,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Uh-huh. 
208,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Do you guys think your characters have any— are you guys weirdly secret, like, die-hard wrestling fans?"
209,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I think Magnus probably is aware of it, maybe not die-hard, but definitely, like, knows of it."
210,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
211,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s the least committal answer ever. [audience laughter]
212,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, Jesus."
213,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, ‘I am aware.’"
214,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Merle knows all the wrestlers from thirty years ago.
215,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. [audience laughter]
216,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Before they went pro.
217,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah.
218,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It was still back-alley wrestling.
219,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Like Dusty Rhodes, the American… well, it wouldn’t be— Rusty Dodes, the American Dream. [audience laugh]"
220,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Which is a shame, because Dusty Rhodes is a much better fantasy wrestler name."
221,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," It is, true, yeah."
222,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What about Taako?
223,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Taako is only familiar with the television show, because ‘Sizzle it Up with Taako,’ his cooking show, was on up against them on basic cable. Basic fantasy, fantasy cable,"
224,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Which literally means that these two live events were taking place at the same time in different places in the world.
225,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Right.
226,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Wonderful. [small audience laugh]
227,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," ‘Cause television does not exist, you’ve made very clear to me."
228,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," But you make your way through the crowd and into this, this uh, ancient-looking building, you’re whisked inside the stage door by a producer who finds your name on a guest list, and inside you see a familiar face, you see Jess the Beheader. "
229,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Jess!!
230,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, The Beheader!
231,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Griffin and audience laugh],
232,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Middle and last names.
233,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
234,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Ey, long time no see! What, whaddya guys been up to since all the train murder stuff?"
235,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, More murder! [he and audience laugh]
236,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Yeah, death, destruction, the usual."
237,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Character voices.
238,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Character fuckin’ VOICES! [audience laugh]
239,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," [in his character voice] Death and destruction, the usual!"
240,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[audience laugh, cheer]",
241,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You—
242,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, That’s the one I picked.
243,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, You sounded more Scottish last time I saw you. [audience laugh]
244,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," [bad Scottish accent] Death an’ destrrrruction, the usual!"
245,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, He’s a different actor this time.
246,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, You sounded less Scottish. [audience laugh]
247,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, Jess is accompanied by a human man, uh, named Derek Humanman [Clint laughs] No, uh, she is accompanied by a human man who doesn’t really have the build of a professional fighter. He is wearing a button-up shirt tucked into some nerdy slacks. He’s got a big pair of round glasses on, he’s got a big bushy beard, and an almost perfectly round belly, and I’m reading that now and I realize that made it sound like he’s Santa Claus, but he’s not. [audience laugh]"
248,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Does it shake when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly? 
249,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," [laughs] Uh, no, it doesn’t."
250,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," [laughing] Well, that’s how you tell them apart! [audience and boys laugh] "
251,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Wait, wait, wait, wait."
252,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," You ever see ‘em fighting and you need to tranq one, [laughter] have ‘em laugh!"
253,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, ‘Now YOU laugh.’
254,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," ‘Now you laugh! Okay, now you!’ [laughter] ‘He’s the clone!’ [laughter]"
255,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," ‘No, watch! It jiggles! Aaaah!’"
256,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," ‘No, watch it jiggle!’ s’DOOF [tranquilizer dart sound effect] [all laugh] I’m sorry, first row! [laugh] You will get wet— you may get drenched. Sorry."
257,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience member, [audible among laughter] Woo!
258,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, so while you all are catching up with Jess, this guy kinda [throat-clearing noise]"
259,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, What was his name? You didn’t say his name.
260,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Just wait, just to be clear, Je— the person accompanying Jess is named Jeff?"
261,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, No.
262,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Okay.
263,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It’s cool.
264,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Derek.
265,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You haven’t asked his name yet, which is sort of a fun running theme."
266,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, lemme try. [audience laugh]"
267,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He clears his throat to kinda like make his presence known and, looks at his watch."
268,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Oh.
269,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Hey, what’s your handle, kemosabe? [audience laugh]"
270,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Nervous-sounding Man," Uhh, oh, hey there, sorry, I’m— I’m Merrick, uh, I’m the CEO here, I uh, Jess told me that you guys were coming, and uh, it’s really nice to meet you, but uh, um, I need you to sign this before you go backstage."
271,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he hands all three of you clipboards with some stuff on it.
272,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Sure, sure. Uh, how have the ratings been this year?"
273,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Oh, real good, we’ve got some really um uh really savage events, it’s been really cool—"
274,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Better recently, probably?"
275,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Yeah, uh, I would say."
276,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, You got rid of that damn cooking show for competition.
277,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Yeah, less competition."
278,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Yeah, about five years ago we had a, a big upswing and it’s been a nice— "
279,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Yeahh, you’re welcome for that."
280,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Yeah, sign this for me? [audience laugh] Your standard talent release, NDA, merchandising, licensing deal, [unintelligible]"
281,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t comfortably give up merchandising. "
282,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [beat] That’s a weird thing that you’ll all learn about Magnus in the NEXT story arc.
283,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," By the way, after the show there’ll be posters out in the lobby. Make sure you..."
284,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Posters.
285,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No that’s true though, there are wonderful, wonderful posters made by Carey Pietsch."
286,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Wonderful posters.
287,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," There will be posters, the best."
288,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Carey, are you here? [cheering from audience]"
289,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Carey’s here! [cheering]
290,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Where are you, Carey?"
291,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You’re not gonna see her no matter where she’s sitting!
292,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, you can’t see anybody past the first two rows. Uh, he looks at you, waiting for you to sign the..."
293,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, yeah, uh, I sign it."
294,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Okay, thank you."
295,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," [beat] 15 years in the future, he opens up a Magnus Park. "
296,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Damn it! [Clint laughs]
297,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He makes 60 million gold pieces.
298,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, My IP!!!
299,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He takes it back,"
300,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Thank you, thank you. Hey, uh, you, little boy. Little boy. Are you a Jeff Angel fan??"
301,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he fishes out a little, uh,"
302,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Please don’t talk to our little boy. 
303,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, He’s OUR little boy. 
304,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Bought him fair and square.
305,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He fishes out a little angel wing button from his nerdy khakis and he hands it out to Angus, and Angus says,"
306,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus," Oh, heck no, sir! I’m no chump mark!"
307,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter] ,
308,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he takes it back.
309,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I high-five Angus.
310,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
311,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merrick," Oh, sorry, sorry kiddo. Welp, [beat] off to business! Business, business time for me!"
312,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"And he turns and leaves. And Jess says,",
313,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Okay, here are the rules. BattleFest Supreme Champion Title—"
314,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, How many holds are barred?
315,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, None of the bars.
316,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, WHOOOOA.
317,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," And none of the holds. None of the bars. [beat] Uh, you got one challenger, or two partners— me and you, Magnus— we’re gonna take on four other fighters which were chosen by a fan vote. If the challengers— me and you— get knocked out or submit during the fight, we lose. If we can knock out or force all four of our opponents to submit, we get to be Supreme Champion. You got it?"
318,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Yes.
319,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Uhh,"
320,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Where do I need to like, sign up for my wrestling name?"
321,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, We’ll figure that out backstage—
322,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, I’ve already got it.
323,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, Okay. [audience laugh] Sit on that plot point for a—
324,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, THEY CALL ME… i'Morko!
325,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, ...What is that?
326,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," It’s Elvish for ‘The Bear’. And I pull out my bear mask from the, uh, the Petals to the Metal—"
327,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Oh yeah. [audience cheer]
328,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, And I put it back on.
329,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I like that. [audience claps]
330,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And he pulls out his dork mask and puts it on over the bear mask.
331,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, [laughs] Fucking—
332,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Listen, ELVISH IS NOT DORKY, DAD! [Clint laughs]"
333,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," That was totally, that had to be in-fiction you saying ‘Elvish is not dorky, Dad’ to Merle. [Justin giggling, audience cheers]"
334,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [doing a voice] ‘And get out of my room!’
335,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," [doing a voice] ‘Leave me alone, DAD! I’m practicing my Elvish!’ [laughter]"
336,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Jess says, uh,"
337,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Magnus, I picked you ‘cause I liked your moves on the Rockport Limited. [boys laugh] And your body type is pretty similar to my last partner, whose name was Brock Thickstone."
338,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," No, yeah. I remember."
339,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," But Merle and Taako, I have jobs for you too. Merle, if you’re willing, we could use a manager in our corner."
340,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, [not in character voice] Oh! Yeah.
341,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," We could use, you know, a hype man, somebody there to work the crowd, get ‘em on our side, but you could also support us from outside the ring if you’re able. Taako— "
342,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I have experience. I was in the JCs.
343,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Uh, she didn’t hear any of that because you didn’t say it in a character voice. [audience laughter] [raises voice] These people paid MONEY to watch us sit here and play D&D, the least we could fuckin’ do is some CHARACTER VOICES!"
344,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [yells] FINE!!! [crowd cheers]
345,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I’m sorry. By the way.
346,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s all right.
347,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience member," We still love you, Merle!"
348,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Aw, no."
349,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Again, kind of a one-way… just… [audience laugh]"
350,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," It’s, yeah."
351,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Unidirectional…
352,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Maybe just a physical thing…
353,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Especially if you’re encouraging my DAD, I’m gonna need you to sit on it. Okay? Thank you. [audience laugh]"
354,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
355,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Taako, your job is the most important job of all."
356,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Go on.
357,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, You need to make sure no one sits in this chair…
358,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Was that a— that was a character voice?
359,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Two words, that’s how we do. Go ahead."
360,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Go on.
361,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," I need you on the catwalks up above keeping an eye on the fight, keeping an eye out for suspicious individuals."
362,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, On the catwalk?
363,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, Yeah.
364,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Yeah, on the catwalk? Okay."
365,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Uh,"
366,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Should I… [audience and boys laugh, Justin snickers] Should I shake my little tush ON the catwalk? [audience cheers] You know what, I know we’re having fun here, Right Said Fred did have some other really good singles you should look into. If you have a few minutes later, I’ll hook you up, I’ve got some tapes."
367,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, [beat] I am regretting how I have assigned the most important job. [all laugh]
368,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Naw, I’m ready."
369,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," So, there is no doubt in my mind that Brock’s death was the result of foul play. I don’t know who’s responsible but I figure whoever they are probably wants me dead too. I need you up there watching my back."
370,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Sure, yeah, okay. No problem."
371,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, Cool. Let’s get you all backstage. 
372,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Um, and you’re backstage."
373,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [woo-woo-woo noises]
374,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, The magic of podcasting.
375,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Um, and it’s really quiet backstage. There are four private dressing rooms that are all shut and there are security personnel in front of all of them, keeping them secret from you."
376,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Do the security personnel look trustworthy?
377,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yes..? [audience laugh]
378,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Would that be some kind of check I would do? Trustworthiness check?
379,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Sure, uh, it’s, wow, we’re actually rolling dice and it’s been 21 minutes. [audience cheers] Uh,"
380,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Do you have a proficiency in trustworthiness?
381,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, it’s not called trustworthiness, it’s callllled…."
382,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Insight?
383,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Insight, yes."
384,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s a 14.
385,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh my god, it really is! [audience laugh]"
386,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, they seem cool."
387,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," They seem cool, okay."
388,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I’m impressed.
389,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Angus, Angus goes over to check out Brock’s locker, start digging through his belongings—"
390,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, His Brocker?
391,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," —his Brocker, looking for clues. Off to one side of this room is another dressing area, there’s a row of mirrors surrounded by lights, and over by a big tall wardrobe is an even taller Goliath man who has pitch-black hair and a sharp little goatee, and he’s wearing a spectacular tuxedo and uh, he looks at all of you as you walk in the room, and Jess says, "
392,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Dante, these are them."
393,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he looks at you and just kinda considers you for a second. And he says, uh. [clears throat] [beat] [all the boys burst into laughter]"
394,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Let me give you a little insight, let me pull aside the curtain. Right now Griffin is running through the database of voices in his head trying to figure out, ‘Which one have I not used yet?’"
395,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, no, I got it. He looks at you and he says"
396,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, [in a very deep voice] No.
397,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And Jess says,"
398,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Dante, come on!"
399,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he says,"
400,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Let me see.
401,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He looks at you, Magnus, and he says"
402,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, I’m sorry. [audience laugh] You have a wonderful body. 
403,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laugh],
404,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Thank you!
405,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, But you do not have the soul of a champion.
406,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I punch him in the face. [audience and Justin laugh]
407,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Roll that.
408,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s an 18!
409,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Oh my god!
410,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," 18 plus 8, a 26."
411,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You— okay, here it is. This is the scene. He says,"
412,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," You have a beautiful body, but you do not have the soul of a champion."
413,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Justin and Travis laughing throughout] ,
414,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And you just, before he finishes you just Pop! And it’s literally just like, his face doesn’t move at all and he goes,"
415,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Interesting. 
416,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience and brothers laugh],
417,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He picks up some glasses from the table and puts them on his gigantic face and he just says,"
418,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, What does it mean to you to be Supreme Champion?
419,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, It means being strong enough to make the weak feel safe.
420,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Oh, god. [Griffin and audience laugh, audience cheers]"
421,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
422,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, What about your friends? Can they vouch for you?
423,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, One of them probably will. [Clint laughs]
424,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He turns to you, Taako and Merle, and says"
425,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Is this good-bodied individual Supreme Champion material? What has he done in the past that has been Champion-like? 
426,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Um…
427,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," By the way, this voice was starting out supposed to be kind of Andre the Giant-esque and then it took a pivot towards fuckin’ Droopy. [audience laughter]"
428,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Kinda got a little Alfred Hitchcock…
429,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, it’s like if Hitchcock and Andre the Giant had a sad baby. [audience laughter]"
430,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He asked you to vouch for Magnus for his Champion qualities.
431,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[unintelligible from audience],
432,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeahh, it’s kind of a one-way thing."
433,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," [unenthusiastically] Yeah, he’s the best. He’s the best."
434,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, He’s really… he’s strong.
435,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, He has proficiencies.
436,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Very good at rolling, if that—"
437,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Carves a mean duck.
438,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Yeah, carves, he’s good at carving stuff. I don’t understand what you’ll need him for, but… yeah."
439,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, I know Champion jealousy when I hear it.
440,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," [unconvincingly] Yeah, that’s what it is, too."
441,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
442,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," Okay, I believe you. I will make you—"
443,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And now he’s Russian.
444,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," He should slow down, we got all night!"
445,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," I will make you, uh, what is your character? What will your, What’s your—"
446,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, My name is... i'Morko! The bear—
447,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," Oh, the bear in Elvish. Yes."
448,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, [imitates guitar riff] That’s a sting I have for— Try it again.
449,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, My name is... i'Morko!
450,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, [imitates guitar riff]
451,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uh, I think he just like has this big table full of fabric and he just throws it up in the air, and just like, like a cartoon, instead of cutting and sewing it—"
452,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I also want to point out I’ve been wearing the bear mask [laughing] this whole time, just like, talking to another grown adult like, “I’m a champion.”"
453,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughs],
454,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think he makes you, sort of, it’s almost maybe, half furry costume, just like the arms and legs. And the audience reaction to that was maybe the best thing I’ve ever heard. [audience cheers] Because it wasn’t like, it was like half “Yeh!” and then the other half “Ahw.” [audience laugh] Just fine, don’t hate. Uh, and, uh, but there’s like a breastplate on it, uh, and, but, furry arms and legs but also like a breastplate on it."
455,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Are there nipples?
456,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Good question.
457,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, There’s eleven nipples.
458,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Eleven nipples.
459,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeeaahhh!!!
460,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Feedin’ time.
461,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You suit up, and he looks at you two. And he says, "
462,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," Hmm. You know, you two have wonderful bodies as well, would you like me to make you all costumes just for funsies?"
463,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, I had to punch you— [irritated noise]
464,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," No, this one’s for funsies. [audience laughs]"
465,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, You guys should do it.
466,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, I’d love a costume because this arm is killin’ me!
467,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," [laughing] Okay, what do you want me to do about— do you want a massage? What’s the...."
468,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Wait a minute, timeout. Does he have it?"
469,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," What? The wooden arm? Yeah, yeah. This is after Crystal Kingdom, you lost that bad boy."
470,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Aww..
471,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin and Griffin," Sorry, Dad."
472,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It’s not real!
473,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Hold on, what would you do? Would you write, like, a letter like ‘Don’t grab that thing that makes you lose your arm!’ And then like seal it and put it in your pocket like Bill and Ted style? [audience laughter]"
474,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s up to Trav.
475,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Why would it be up to—
476,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I would do it even if I knew what was going to happen. 
477,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience wooing],
478,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He asked you if guys want—
479,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I rolled a 16, if that matters."
480,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Do you all want wrestling costumes as well, or do you want to go—"
481,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, [quietly] Go for it!
482,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Yeah!
483,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, What are you thinking?
484,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Um...
485,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You’ll actually be, like, you’ll actually be out there, you’ll be ringside, the manager. So it may make sense for Merle to also have a persona. "
486,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Something with, uh, stripes?"
487,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Stripes-man.
488,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, They’re very slimming.
489,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, You just want to be stripes-man?
490,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, [long beat] Yeah!
491,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," For those of you at home, he is nodding."
492,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Emphatically.
493,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah.
494,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I think he does the same thing and he just makes you the sleaziest-looking suit you’ve ever seen.
495,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I like.
496,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And like, maybe 12 pounds worth of fake, like, chains, and the suit is pinstriped? And he’s like,"
497,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante," Uh, I will call you Pinstripe. [audience laugh]"
498,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s good.
499,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, How come he gets to pick his name?
500,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Well you didn’t pick yours!
501,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Because you didn’t say anything!
502,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I would— [sputters] Pause!
503,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Paws?
504,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Gimme a pause so I can jump [unintelligible]
505,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, [sighs] Okay.
506,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Pinstripe. I like Pinstripe.
507,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that’s— Fuck. [audience laugh]"
508,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I think it’s very appropriate. And it’s very slimming.
509,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, Magic boy. [audience laughter]
510,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Magic man. [bigger laugh, Travis cackles] Listen—"
511,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Magic Mike!
512,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Here’s my character. And this is kind of a meta one, so hang in there. His name is Tuff Greg. Now here’s Tuff Greg’s thing. He’s kinda—"
513,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Is it T-U-F-F?
514,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Yeah. That’s good. He’s kind of an everyman? And I want his uniform— this is when you’re making it— I want it to look exactly like the crew you have working the show. So the theme of it would be— 
515,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[Griffin cackles, audience cheers]",
516,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"The theme of it would be like, he just got up there like ‘What’s Tuff Greg doing?’ but otherwise indiscernible from everybody else in the show. Like, you wouldn’t raise an eye no matter where you saw this guy. Tuff Greg. The character of wrestling.",
517,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[Griffin cackles again, the audience cheers]",
518,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think he says, uh,"
519,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dante, I have the perfect idea of how to accomplish this.
520,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Impress me.
521,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he just walks over to one of those security guys, who is perfectly Taako-shaped, and just grabs his shirt and pants and pulls, but it doesn’t rip them, just the clothes come off? [Justin and audience laugh]"
522,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Okay.
523,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And the security guy’s a pro, so he doesn’t move."
524,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, [laughing] Doesn’t blink an eye.
525,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he just hands them to you, and they are your perfect size."
526,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Perfect.
527,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," You oughta at least cut the sleeves off, ‘cause that’s, that’s very in."
528,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," No, I want it to be INDISCERNIBLE."
529,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," But then they’re always gonna confuse you with the p— aaaaaaah, alright, yeah, okay. Aaaahhh. I see."
530,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You guys are all costumed up, and, uh, before the fight begins,"
531,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, How do we look?
532,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You look fucking ridiculoooouusss.
533,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, But in a good way?
534,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yes, sure. Uh, Jess says, uh, before you go out there,"
535,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Oh, one last thing. "
536,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And she opens up a locker and she says,"
537,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Magnus and Merle, you’re gonna need to put all your weapons in here."
538,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Wha...? I’m. Not so good without them. [laughs weakly, the crowd also laughs]"
539,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," I know, it’s BattleFest rules though."
540,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Mmmm, but not the gloves, right? That’s part of my costuuuuume."
541,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, The clothes?
542,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, My gloves!
543,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," No, all of it’s…."
544,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, I got a tree arm.
545,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," That’s super great. Hey, what happened there, by the way? You had two—"
546,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, We’ll tell you later.
547,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Son of a bitch cut my arm off. That’s what the hell happened—
548,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, I SAVED. YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.
549,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," No, you cut it off!"
550,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, By Pan’s name! 
551,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
552,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I give Railsplitter a gentle kiss.
553,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. [audience laugh]
554,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I place it in the—
555,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," That’s the name of your axe, I hope to god."
556,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah. And I place it gently in the locker and I say, ‘I’ll be back. Don’t be scared.’ [audience laugh]"
557,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You hear it go [whimpering noise]
558,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, WHAT???
559,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, I’m just kidding."
560,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," And I hang up, let’s see. Phantom Fist,"
561,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, shit."
562,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, This is gonna take all night.
563,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," My rapier, my shortbow— and I’m doing this from memory. And, can I keep the Fletcher’s Mitt? It’s not a weapon."
564,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," No gloves, it’s a no gloves policy too."
565,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, The Fletcher’s Mitt… do I get to keep my shield?
566,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Uh, probably not, no."
567,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience member," [distant, very quiet] What about Steven?!"
568,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, STEVEN’S NOT A WEAPON! [crowd laugh] He is an agent of love. [crowd laugh]
569,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I’m gonna move things along. Let’s just say you upload-- you put all your weapons in there.
570,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Okay, I put everything in there."
571,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Taako, you’re allowed to keep your umbrella. And Merle, you’re allowed to keep your bible, your Extreme Teen Bible. It’s not a weapon, it’s a book. And, oh yeah, show everybody your— "
572,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You mean THIS Extreme Teen Bible? [crowd cheers] Also on sale in the lobby after the show.
573,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Not true.
574,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Not true.
575,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s a lie.
576,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Thank you, pal. You can order ‘em…"
577,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," All right, let’s move forward to BattleFest. I’m gonna split the party up. Yeah, I know. It’s a few minutes ‘til showtime,"
578,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [laughs] Ooooooh!
579,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It’s a few minutes ‘til showtime, and Merle and Magnus, you guys are at the top of the entrance ramp behind a curtain. You can hear the crowd, they sound just as rambunctious as they did outside. Taako, Jess has taken you to a service elevator, fulfilling our contractual obligation to have an elevator in this live episode of the- show Adventure Zone? "
580,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[crowd laughs and cheers] ,
581,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You take the elevator up to the catwalk of Chaos Stadium, and below you can see this sold-out crowd that you’ve been hearing chant backstage for the past hour. There’s easily 20,000 people here all just screaming their brains out."
582,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, What are they chanting?
583,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," So we’re looking at kind of an arena, [crowd cheering] we’re looking at kind of an arena? Calm down, okay, please."
584,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yes, it is an arena, like an indoor...."
585,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, So the catwalk would be sorta like a network of.... (unintelligible)
586,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah so, the catwalk is actually two long beams that intersect with two other beams going in the other direction—"
587,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," How high up is it? Like real, real high?"
588,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It’s about… no, it’s not that high, it’s about 25 feet up? There’s some lights hanging off of it over the ring. The ring, by the way is a hexagon-shaped? There’s six sides. Six points."
589,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Can the boy detective go up there too?
590,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, what’s Ango doing during all this?"
591,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, the boy detective—"
592,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus," (dejected) I’m sorry sirs, I couldn’t find any good clues. I guess this one’s just out of my hands. (brightly) Anyway, I’m gonna go get a—"
593,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, You looked in the— There was nothing in the locker?
594,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, I’m gonna go get a big pretzel and watch the shooowwwwww ‘cause. [crowd laughs]
595,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, So this is a cameo. Okay.
596,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus," It is, uh, my birthday… so…"
597,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Ango, I am dedicating this fight to you. If I win, you won’t die of some terrible disease. [crowd laughs]"
598,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I give no such reassurance.
599,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
600,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, (dismayed) Am I sick?! [crowd laugh]
601,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Not yet. [beat] Give it time.
602,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So Taako, you’re up on this catwalk, and you’ve just gone up the elevator."
603,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Did it— [sound from audience, pause] uh, uh…."
604,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Did it what.
605,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Are we like- Does the match start?
606,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, not yet."
607,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay. So can I go up to the catwalk, do I have to be up on the catwalk already or can I still be like backstage hanging out?"
608,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Do you have a fun scene you wanna do? Okay, yeah, no you haven’t [audience laugh] you haven’t gone up yet."
609,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," We don’t rehearse this show ahead of time, so."
610,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, quick retcon."
611,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," This isn’t a fun scene. If, in my outfit,"
612,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah.
613,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I wanna go to where their weapons are being stored.
614,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
615,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," And I am going to… What’s the situation with the place where, are they locked up, or what’s up?"
616,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, they’re locked up in Jess’s locker. You guys are, let’s say you guys have already gone out the entrance ramp so you’re not really in the locker room anymore. You still are. You guys are…."
617,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Did we only check our weapons or did we keep all our other stuff?
618,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You kept your Bible and your pants or whatever.
619,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Did I keep Nitpicker?
620,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You did, but you’re not with Taako. We’re getting hung up, quick! Quick, do something, do something!"
621,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, I wanna, so I’m gonna open her locker—"
622,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
623,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, With Knock.
624,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. Bing! 
625,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Uhh, and then…"
626,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Is that what you do?
627,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Mmh?
628,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Is that the sound it makes?
629,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," At home? Uh, no, I’m gonna cast Leomund’s Secret Chest? Which lets, creates ‘an exquisite chest’ that I can hide on the Ethereal Plane."
630,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
631,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [slightly hysterical] Does it say the word exquisite on your card??
632,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Yes. [Travis and crowd laugh]
633,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, All of Taako’s spells are exquisite.
634,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, On MY cards it says exquisite.
635,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yes. And you always roll 20s.
636,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I love that.
637,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah. Yeah, so I throw everything into the exquisite chest and stuff it into the Ethereal Plane."
638,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. And what do you do with the chest?
639,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, You’ll find out.
640,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, cool. [audience laugh]"
641,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Foreshadowing.
642,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," All right, let’s fast-forward back to where we were. You’re up on the catwalk, you can see this crowd below, you’re about 25 feet up from the ring, and over this series of… it’s like a hashtag shape, like two and two intersecting?"
643,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Gotcha.
644,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Don’t laugh at me making a hashtag shape with my hands. [audience laughs louder] I was very vulnerable…
645,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," By the way, that’s “hashtag HashtagShape”. [audience laugh]"
646,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I was very vulnerable in that moment. Um, and as you come up the elevator, you see a young humanman, who is operating a spotlight, but he hasn’t heard you over the roar of the crowd. He is shining his light onto an emcee who slides through the ropes of the ring and walks to the middle of the stage and grabs a hanging microphone that’s being slowly lowered down by this spotlight boy. "
647,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Merle and Magnus, you are on the entrance ramp with Jess behind a thick curtain that’s kind of muffling the MC as he gives the three of you your grand introduction, and Jess says,"
648,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, Anything else you two need to know before we get out there?
649,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, What’s our entrance music?
650,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Yeah, like, what are we doing?"
651,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Well, you guys can just come out to mine, we’ve got the—"
652,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Okay. 
653,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Ohh... 
654,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Who are we facing? Are there any weaknesses, or?"
655,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," No, that’s the whole thing, we don’t know. That’s the whole thing, it’s a secret fan vote."
656,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Cool, cool."
657,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Oh, I thought of something."
658,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Yeah?
659,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
660,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, We’re heels. [beat] Do you know what that means? [audience begins to laugh]
661,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," No, what?"
662,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, We make people feel better?
663,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
664,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, Something like that.
665,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, —and then pushes the two of you through the curtain onto the top of the ramp.
666,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And for a second,"
667,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Wait, hold on, does that mean we’re jerks?"
668,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And for a second, when you walk out to the ramp and the spotlight is on you and this music is playing, the spotlight is shining on the three of you, there’s silence, and then there is a deafening wave of boos."
669,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah!
670,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience boos loudly],
671,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, There we go.
672,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And Jess is just -
673,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," I don’t think they like that idea, Griffin. [audience laugh]"
674,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," [laughs] Jess is just fucking eating it up. She’s actually- you see now that she has a bunch of paper-mache severed heads that she’s throwing into the audience like, “Yeaaahhh!” [audience laughs and claps]"
675,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, We’ll be selling those after the show too.
676,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I want you to know I, Travis McElroy, love this. "
677,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, yeah."
678,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Magnus Burnsides HATES this. [audience laugh]
679,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, sure. And she holds up her hand in the air and her soulbound axe that she had on the train arc appears in her hand, and she just like buries it in the top of the ramp and, like, runs down to the ring."
680,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I kind of jog after her like, “Uhhhh,” [audience laugh]"
681,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, what are you all doing going down the ramp?"
682,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I’m kind of doing claw motions with my hands.
683,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," This is a hostile - [cheers and claps from crowd, presumably Travis was doing the gestures] [big audience laugh ]"
684,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I’ll do Fosse hands. 
685,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, that’s perfect!"
686,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," I’m doing Fosse hands, jazz hands. Jazz Hands."
687,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You’re just gonna Fosse-step the whole way down? (sings) “Hey, I’m Pinstripe -”"
688,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s [unintelligible] from Pinstripe!
689,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Do a little grapevine. Yeah. For you dancers out there.
690,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You make your way down to the ring. Taako -
691,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," As they’re entering, I’ve cast Arcane Eye, and am having it hover around the crowd. I can move it up to 30 feet with an action, but since we’re not technically in combat -"
692,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Sure.
693,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I just want to have it hovering around, just to give me another set of eyeballs to rely on."
694,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah no that’s good. You don’t necessarily see- I mean, everybody’s, like, cosplaying and it’s a crazy wild scene, but you don’t see anybody, like, holding a dark orb and, like, chanting into it. But you do catch the attention of the boy running the spotlight. This is just after they’ve made it to the stage, and they take up a couple minutes just soaking up the boos - well, that sounds bad. [crowd laugh]"
695,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s what we did backstage!
696,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah. Yeah. And this boy says, uh,"
697,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Squeaky-voiced teen," Hey, you’re not supposed to be up here!"
698,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," (doing a deep ‘manly’ voice) Hey, it’s me, Greg! [audience laughter and claps]"
699,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Squeaky-voiced teen," Well, you’re wearing my clothes, that’s kind of ironclad."
700,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," There’s no way it’s the same guy, I’m not wearing HIS clothes!"
701,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," ‘Cause he’d be naked, right?"
702,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, ‘Cause he’d be naked!
703,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Squeaky-voiced teen," I meant my uniform! It’s the only clothes I have, so I just call this uniform ‘my clothes’."
704,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laugh] ,
705,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"It’s not funny, why are you laughing, it’s the only clothes I have! ",
706,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience and Justin laugh],
707,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"Do you have - I’m the only one that’s supposed to be up on the catwalk, they call me Catwalk Boy.",
708,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience and Travis laugh],
709,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"They call me Gerald, the Catwalk Boy. ",
710,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience and Travis laugh],
711,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," Well, uh, as I always say to the wife before I hop into bed, ‘Make room for Greg! ‘Cause, uh, Greg’s here.’"
712,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Gerald," Greg, do you have your ID -"
713,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Taako (as Tuff Greg), That’s my handle!
714,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Gerald," Greg, do you have your ID badge on you?"
715,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Taako (as Tuff Greg), Sure.
716,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Push him off the catwalk.
717,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I cast Charm Person. [audience laugh/cheer] There’s my ID badge, you uppity so-and-so!"
718,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I get to roll on that, don’t I?"
719,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, No...
720,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, with the Charisma check of CATWALK BOY."
721,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, I roll a Wisdom saving -"
722,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," [giggling throughout] Maybe he is charismatic, he is just in the wrong line of work. [audience laugh] Uh, I attempt to charm… no, it’s even better, it’s a Wisdom saving throw. All the wisdom of Catwalk Boy. [beat] That’s a natural 20. [audience cheers, Justin giggles]"
723,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Catwalk Greg just says,"
724,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Gerald, [beat] No. Not anymore.
725,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Not on his watch.
726,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, ‘Not again!’
727,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he reaches into his pocket and calmly says,"
728,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,        Gerald," Sir, I’m gonna need to ask you to calmly stay put."
729,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he starts to pull out -
730,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I’m sorry, did they arm him?"
731,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He’s actually pulling out a Stone of Farspeech. And is starting to bring it up to his face. What do you do?
732,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, (softly) Hold on a second.
733,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Kill him.
734,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I’m not gonna kill -
735,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, WHY?
736,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I’m not gonna kill Catwalk Boy.
737,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s a GAME. [audience laugh] He’s not a real person!
738,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [laughs] Life and death is just a game to Clint McElroy.
739,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [beat] Eh.  
740,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," [singing] You shoulda had these prepared, before you came on -"
741,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Well I didn’t know what kind of fuckin’ magical scenarios I was gonna get into! I am going to cast…
742,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Just draw a random one.
743,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [stage whisper] Kill. Him.
744,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," What? Just draw a random one, see how that goes? I could do that..."
745,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [growling into the microphone in a terrifying whisper] KILL. HIM.
746,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Um, okay. I cast… Gust of Wind?"
747,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Holy shit. [audience cheer/laugh]
748,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Want me to do a little Foley work for ya?
749,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," No, that’s okay."
750,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay.
751,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, I cast Gust of Wind on him."
752,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [makes a wooshing sfx anyways]
753,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," It’s only 25 feet, it’ll be fine?"
754,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," What is that, I don’t have that one in my doc."
755,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, It’s “a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction --”
756,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Oh, that ain’t, that ain’t him. [audience laugh]"
757,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And you know there are people underneath you.
758,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, What?
759,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," That’s a 10. No. So sweet- sweet Catwalk Boy, [audience laugh] Are you blowing him towards the ring or just kind of into the crowd?"
760,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I’m blowing him into the crowd where they can catch him safely. [Travis and Griffin laugh]
761,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I’m gonna make a collective dexterity throw for ‘CROWD’. [audience laugh] That’s a 14, okay, they kinda catch him? You hear a,"
762,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gerald, (gradually getting distant) Auuuaghghgaaaah! [audience laugh]
763,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he actually comically drops his Stone of Farspeech as he goes. And the stage goes dark. And it’s dark for a bit and then you hear from the stone,"
764,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gruff voice, Gerald? [beat] Gerald. Where’s the spotlight? Gerald.
765,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," Go for Greg! [audience and Clint laugh] Hey, this is Greg, I heard you got a spotlight issue, my man."
766,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gruff voice, Greg? Where’s Gerald?
767,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," Went out for a dookie break, brother. You want me to take the spotlight or what? [audience cheers and claps]"
768,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gruff voice," Yeah, just get a light on my fighters."
769,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," He went out to smoke a Fantasy Cigarette, and now you got Greg on the horn."
770,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gruff voice, Just turn the light on and shine it on my fighters!
771,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," You got it, bubbeleh, any direction you want it aimed, or what?"
772,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Gruff voice, [beat] The -- FIGHTER-wards!
773,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," Hey, no need to yell, my man, we’re all friends here. You got Greg on the job now.  All right. I’ll fire up the spotlight, which I know how to use. [audience laugh]"
774,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, ‘Cause you’re Greg!
775,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Hold on. Let me do a... is it a magical spotlight?
776,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, [snorts] NO??
777,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, (incredulous) Is it an electrical spotlight?
778,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Careful.
779,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, (carefully) No.
780,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Everything you say becomes canon.
781,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s right. Is it a cannon?
782,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, I’ll do a... Investigation check to see if I can --"
783,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, To see if you can figure out how to work spotlight. [Clint laughs]
784,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s a 15 plus…
785,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that’s good enough. Yeah, you know how to use Spotlight, it’s a fuckin’ light that you point at things."
786,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, At a certain spot.
787,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Hey. (to the audience) If you’ve ever run spotlight before, raise your hand. [unintelligible] It’s an art, right? [crosstalk]"
788,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Wow, a lot of theater tech people at a D&D show. Who’d’ve guessed?"
789,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, It’s an art.
790,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Did you do it for a living?
791,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, No.
792,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, No.
793,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, No. It is a hobby.
794,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," We gotta move. We’ve been going for like 45 minutes, we gotta really get some --"
795,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And all of a sudden, all the lights go out."
796,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, I’m going to describe now the four entrances of the fighters you’ll be facing off against, I’m just going to try to get through it as fast as possible so we can get into this thing."
797,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The lights go dark, a shaky spotlight comes up, and a burst of flowers, of roses, comes from the ramp, from behind the curtain. And out comes a woman wearing a red tricorn hat that reaches out to a sharp point forward, she’s got a yellow feather sticking out. Her costume almost looks like fencing gear. She doesn’t have like a fencing foil or anything like that but that is kind of her style. And the audience is like losing their mind for this fighter, [audience cheer] There is a sign that unfurls, that heralds her as Queen Sabine. And she is moving down this ramp with attitude. She’s got a pair of sunglasses on that she just kind of flings into the crowd."
798,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Ah. Like David Caruso?
799,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Not that—When the FUCK has David Caruso ever been like, ‘Here comes a pun… The delivery of said pun.’"
800,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," You know, I didn’t have to be here tonight, Griffin."
801,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Jess leans over to you and kinda hunkers down - ‘cause you’re standing like by the corner of the ring - and she says,"
802,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Okay, shit, that’s Sabine. We used to be tag-team partners but then she got injured so I got a new partner and then she got salty about it, and now we’re kind of bitter rivals."
803,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, What’s her deal?
804,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," She’s very fast. Why don’t you leave her to me. Magnus, you focus on the other folks that come out that curtain, and Merle you just keep us in the fight. Once all six of us are in the ring, the fight’s gonna kick off."
805,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, So it’s us two versus three people.
806,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, You got it.
807,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Yeahhh. Cool.
808,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[a],
809,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Is he bigger than me?
810,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Um, yes. And I think his promo is he just points at you, Magnus, and he points at his open mouth, and then he rubs his belly. [audience laugh]"
811,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I flip him off.
812,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Is Death Man one that Merle recognizes?
813,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, I think you… uh, no, this is a different franchise probably than the one that Merle was a fan of."
814,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, He liked that weird Canadian shit.
815,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah.
816,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah.
817,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then the arena goes dark again, and this time a floating image of two moons appears over the ramp. [Travis giggles] Yeah, okay. [audience laugh]"
818,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Woof.
819,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And in front of that projection you see the silhouette of a man, who changes shape in the moonlight, transforming basically into a werewolf before dashing out of the projection. And a fighter appears at the top of the ramp. Their name appears in the image, and their name is Moonbeam. "
820,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"And Moonbeam is another sort of massive, hulking figure wearing a black spandex onesie with silver trim, and has a, actually a luchador mask on? From the edges of both the mask and the onesie you can see these big thick tufts of brown fur that are poking out, and there’s a big silver crescent moon on their onesie. And I think once they make it into the ring they point at you, Magnus, and they point at their open mouth and then rub their tummy? And then Death Man walks up and kinda tugs on their shoulder, like (vague whispering) ‘no you can’t..’ (whispering) ‘yeah, I just did that’",
821,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I point back at both of them and point at my mouth and rub my tummy with both hands.
822,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then he just kinda sulkingly walks to the corner. And then the lights go out one more time, a spotlight shines down on the top of the ramp, and two large prop angel wings spread out from the sides of the entrance curtain. A sign swings down from the ceiling announcing the entrance of a fighter named Jeff Angel. And before I describe Jeff Angel’s entrance I would very much like to play his entrance music, which is the only piece of original music that I have prepared for the evening. (to the sound guy) If you could play ‘Jeff Angel’s Theme’ from… there it is. And really crank it up?"
823,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[MUSIC, ‘Jeff Angel’s Theme’ by Griffin McElroy begins playing]
824,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Shh, let ‘em listen. [beat] Wow, I can feel that in my nards."
825,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Please do not talk over the drop.
826,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, right."
827,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[the iconic melody of John Cena’s entrance music plays],
828,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," (over the music) Wearing a pair of blue denim pants that appear to be cut off at the knee. [beat] Which is a type of wizardry your mind can barely conceive of. [beat] Wearing two bright green wristbands, and absolutely no shirt, enters Jeff Angel. [beat] Half bird, half man. [Clint laughs] [beat] With long bright white feathers and two long beautiful wings. You can turn down Jeff Angel’s theme song."
829,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Without even thinking, Magnus bursts into applause."
830,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience claps and cheers],
831,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The audience reaction to Jeff Angel is mixed, at best. [laughter] Uh, and, uh, he jumps into the ring and he flies up a little bit– he’s Aarakocra, by the way, which is a fun new D&D race. Um, and he grabs the microphone that’s starting to be raised up. He, like, grabs it and pulls it back down, and he says, "
832,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jeff Angel," (with large, projected voice) My name is Jeff Angel."
833,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[Travis clapping, audience giving a ‘mixed’ reception to Jeff] ",
834,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," That’s great. Says, uh,"
835,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jeff," And I value three things above all integrity, hard work, and being nice to kids! [audience laughs and cheers] Now, uh, I don’t know much about Jess’s new partner and manager here, but I do know one thing these seem like the type of guys that forget to call their dads on their birthdays!"
836,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience boos/cheers],
837,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, August 10th? I would never forget! 
838,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
839,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheers],
840,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," From the rafters, you hear, "
841,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako (as Tuff Greg)," (distantly) You tell ‘em, Jeff!"
842,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Gary’s a Jeff-head.
843,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then, uh–"
844,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Greg. (in sarcastic voice) Sorry.
845,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
846,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then, uh, [starts laughing] that’s the end of his speech. [continues laughing]"
847,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I call my dad every day!
848,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [snorts and giggles]
849,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Back to Taako, real quick. A door at one of the ends of the catwalk opens up and two security guards come barging in. And just as they point in your direction [anticipatory music begins to play] and yell something, the starting bell below rings. Let’s roll some initiative."
850,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheers loudly],
851,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[MUSIC, “Jeff Angel Theme” by Griffin McElroy fades in]
852,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,{Commercial Break, 5645-10345}
853,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[MUSIC, “Jeff Angel Theme” by Griffin McElroy fades out]
854,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I got a 13.
855,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," I got a 14, but I roll again cus of some thingamajig that I have."
856,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It’s been so long. What’d you get?
857,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, 18!
858,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Nice.
859,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Plus what?
860,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Plus... 
861,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yep.
862,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Plus...
863,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yep.
864,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Somebody out there knows.
865,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Jesus.
866,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, that’s not what we’re doing!"
867,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What’d you get Taako?
868,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," What, what am I doing? Where? What am I looking at?"
869,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
870,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Oh no, the app is broken."
871,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," It’s not so easy is it, smart ass."
872,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, There you go. There’s a box called initiative―
873,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, See? Zero initiative so I was right! [shouts] 18!
874,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
875,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, Regis Philbin. Taako, what’d you got?"
876,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Do you feel like I should have advantage on that cus I had the Arcane Eye that probably saw the door opening.
877,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, I like that!"
878,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, ‘Kay good. I had a―
879,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, We know you were really gonna try tonight.
880,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I had a bad one but, 6. It’s initiative, that’s good! That’s what you want, you want low."
881,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, You want to go last.
882,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, You want low because it starts 1 and goes…
883,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Uhhhh….
884,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Shit. I actually don’t know if that was a joke or not.
885,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And that makes you adorable.
886,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I just wait for people to say, ‘Go Taako!’ and ‘s like, ‘Okay! I’ll go!’"
887,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," First in the order is Merle! Off to the corner of the ring-- so again just to sort of lay out the objectives here Magnus, you’re trying to beat the four fighters. Jess says she can handle Sabine, so really you’ve got Jeff Angel, Death Man, and Moonbeam. Merle, you’re off to the side, you’ve got to keep everybody sort of healthy and vital but if you want to get in there and mix it up that would be fun and inexplicable but go for it. And Taako you are beset upon by two security guards but you’re also trying to keep them safe from an assassin."
888,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, How far away are the security guards?
889,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I mean, it’s not gonna be your turn for such a long time―"
890,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Perfect.
891,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, ―that I feel like I have a while to figure that out.
892,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Perfect, that’s perfect."
893,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, But they’re about 30 feet away from you. Let’s say 29 feet in case you’ve got a good 30-foot spell. Merle! What are you doing?
894,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I’m going to do something really out of character.
895,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
896,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," I’m going to cast, like, a cleric thing."
897,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter then cheering],
898,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah. I thought about casting Zone of Truth but I’m gonna save that.
899,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, (emotionally) I never call my dad!
900,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," For an even more inappropriate moment. I cast Aid, which is a spell that bolsters my allies with toughness and resolve."
901,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I bet you’re regretting wearing those prop glasses―
902,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I can’t see shit.
903,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
904,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Travis, just read his cards for him, I had to dress him backstage."
905,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I did the resolve part.
906,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, each target’s hit point maximum, current hit points, increase by five for the duration."
907,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Some nice shit there, right?"
908,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, So now Magnus has five extra hit points?
909,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, and it permanently- or it increases for the duration of the thing so you can heal back up to that level,"
910,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Sure.
911,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, So I’m gonna cast that on… [beat]
912,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Magnus?
913,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Magnus! Played by Travis McElroy.
914,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Well, you remembered that one, huh."
915,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I have to.
916,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Legally.
917,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You’re a dependent.
918,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You cast a spell- You cast―
919,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Wait, I am not! I am thirty-two-goddamn-years old―"
920,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah but I’m still claiming ya.
921,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Let’s never release this episode!
922,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah. I think you cast that spell on Magnus and then from the crowd you hear like,"
923,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,NPC," Yeahh, great buff."
924,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Is that what it’s called?
925,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,NPC, It’s all about the f―
926,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You hear one cleric in the audience just go like,"
927,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,NPC," Yeah man, it’s all about the fundamentals."
928,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And it was on that night, July 15th, 2016 I cast a buff."
929,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Magnus, you are-- oh actually, next in the order is Jess and Sabine, who I think just do that wrestler thing where they just like, run up to each other and just like, start hitting each other very fast and they’re sort of tied up. Magnus it is your turn, next in the order."
930,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m going to.. How are they all standing? Where is everybody.
931,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Each one is in like a corner right now. Or they moved in a little bit from the corner but they’re..
932,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Do we have-- this is an important question.
933,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah.
934,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Turnstile ropes, the whole ti―"
935,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Turnstile ropes, three ropes, the whole thing"
936,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Great, I’m going to make like I’m running at Moonbeam."
937,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
938,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Like, y’know, maybe like a stiff-arm."
939,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Sure.
940,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," But at the last minute I’m gonna pull stiff-arm, bounce off the rope and come at his back."
941,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay. I want you to, no joke, I want you to describe every maneuver that you do with that level of detail."
942,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, You’ve got it!
943,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Go ahead and roll your attack roll and then, depending on―"
944,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[metallic clinking],
945,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, that’s my keychain! [laughs]"
946,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Don’t roll your keychain.
947,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, that’s a 3."
948,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[laughter],
949,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint and Travis, [making a ‘WHOA-OH-OH’ sounds]
950,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Plus 8, 11."
951,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," God, that’s so many, but still no. So you do like a- you bounce off the ropes and you come at him with your stiff-arm and then you hit him and you just kinda like, push forward, like, "
952,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, UuuUUhhHHHH [making a pathetic moaning sound] Can he make that noise? uuUUUhhHHHH.
953,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And I think Moonbeam just kinda pushes you away.
954,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I get multiple attacks per round.
955,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, go ahead."
956,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," And now I’m gonna try to, I don’t know.. Uhhmmm. [high-pitched, uncertain voice] Scissor kick, is that thing? I’m just gonna jump on Moonbeam’s back and cover his eyes."
957,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Make him guess who it is!
958,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, but like, in a really angry way. I’m a bad guy. Rawr."
959,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uhh, okay. What do you think that would be, like a―"
960,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I think I would just do it.
961,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I think it would be a―
962,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Acrobatics?
963,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, I think it would be a strength check, probably."
964,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh no, there’s one of my d20s gone. Okay. Strength check? I’m good at those!"
965,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, cus he’s gonna try to wrestle you off."
966,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," That’s a seventeen plus eight, 25."
967,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I got an 18 so that’s good enough. Okay you’re now covering his eyes and kind of―
968,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, and also, I’m saying really mean things in his ear."
969,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Like what?
970,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Like, you’re a poop and nobody likes you! I’m a jerk, rawr."
971,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay. I think next up is-- not I think, I have a list of people, it’s Death Man, is up next. Death Man is just gonna run and he was gonna attack you, Magnus, but I think he’s just gonna kinda spear tackle the two of you."
972,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Two of who??
973,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Moonbeam and Magnus.
974,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay [sigh of relief]
975,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Can I use my cunning action now?
976,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uhh, no? [drowned out It's not your turn-]"
977,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, How many turns do you get?!
978,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I get a lot man, how many spells do you get?"
979,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, One a time.
980,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Alright. Asked and answered.
981,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He tackles the two of you, which does damage to both of you, but it unfortunately knocks you off his back and both of you are now prone on the ground."
982,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Poop.
983,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And take.. oh my god, take 11 points of damage."
984,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[??? gasps],
985,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m gonna do parry.
986,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, what’s that do?"
987,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," When hit, use the dice to reduce damage by d8."
988,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, just do it."
989,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Mmkay.
990,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," D&D, invented by Gary Gygax. "
991,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," (to himself) Uhh, this one.."
992,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Welcome to the Exposition Zone!
993,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," That’s a four, plus my dexterity, which is two so, [unintelligible] 6."
994,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
995,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Y’know what I didn’t bring?
996,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What?
997,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Anything to write anything down with!
998,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Ohh no! Do we have a pen? Can somebody in the-- throw a, just throw a-- don’t throw it, that would be bad, but--"
999,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Please don’t throw it.
1000,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Because obviously we are not very dexterous. 
1001,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[sound of a pen being thrown/caught],
1002,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter and commotion] ,
1003,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Geez!
1004,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Alright, please stop."
1005,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, O-KAY. We are good now! Thank you.
1006,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Kelsey, everybody, thank you Kelsey!"
1007,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Got a pen!
1008,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Alright, uhh."
1009,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Thank you.
1010,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Some pruning shears?
1011,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Next in the order is Jeff Angel. And Jeff Angel waves his hand in front of his face, and then disappears."
1012,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1013,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Would you guys buy action figures of these wrestlers?
1014,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I feel like a―
1015,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, That would be- we would get busted for intellectual property theft so fast.
1016,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Really, is that somebody?"
1017,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Have you heard of the wrestler named Jonathan Cena?
1018,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I like him, he was very, he was..."
1019,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," He was a great singer, wasn’t he?"
1020,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Great singer, yeahh... What?"
1021,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, John Cena?
1022,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay so, Moonbeam is next and Moonbeam stands up from being prone, so move action, and Moonbeam is going to get on top of you, Magnus, for a pin."
1023,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No he’s not-- wait, what, is he?"
1024,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He is going to get on top of you for―
1025,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Check your notes.
1026,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Make a strength check with me.
1027,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Can I first, like, say something to him?"
1028,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1029,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Let’s fuck up this old man first, like, if you beat me you’re just going to have to face him, so why don’t we tag team him?"
1030,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, their only objective is only to take out you and Jess."
1031,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, reeeally?"
1032,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeahh, it’s them four against you. What you got."
1033,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, What are we doing? Strength?
1034,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Hey can I, quick time out. I feel like in the fiction he would have said that and I feel like you would need to respond, because it seems like in fiction he would have thought that―"
1035,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, he says, uh,"
1036,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Character voices!
1037,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I did mine.
1038,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Oh…
1039,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says, uh,"
1040,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Moonbeam, No.
1041,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, It's the character voice police.
1042,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[laughter],
1043,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," We finally got ‘em all in one room boys! Everybody except the portly one. He crushes it every episode, he’s trying!"
1044,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1045,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
1046,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Moonbeam," I feel like I should listen to you but,"
1047,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Yeah.
1048,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Moonbeam, I think I’m just gonna pin you instead.
1049,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, S’fair. 
1050,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Are you gonna roll that dice?
1051,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Umm, it’s eight plus eight, 16."
1052,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, okay, he’s on top of you now so if it gets back to Moonbeam’s turn you have lost the wrestling match."
1053,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m not going to. I think the person that that definitely needs to be directed to is my buff friend.
1054,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Ohh really, arm chopper?"
1055,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," First up is the- oh boy. A lot of stuff surfacing tonight. Next up, actually, is the security guards who run over to you, Taako, "
1056,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Perfect.
1057,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Recognize you as not one of their own.
1058,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Yeah.
1059,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Uhhm, and, I don’t know how they do it- maybe they have a special pair of glasses on that lets them see.. [gradually breaks into laughter]"
1060,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, It seems like you kinda cheated around my good idea.
1061,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah no, okay. Alright alright, they run over to you and say, uhh. uhh... [beat] [choppy laugh] I fucking forgot his name already, Catwalk Gerald."
1062,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Jer, Jerry?"
1063,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Catwalk Boy, I think it was."
1064,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Guard NPC," Catwalk Boy Gerald fell down and he came to us and said that a guy matching your description knocked him off. You wouldn’t happen to know anything about this, would you?"
1065,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," (as Tuff Greg) Yeah, you guys got me fair and square, let’s get outta here."
1066,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1067,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay. They’re going to put a plastic zip-tie around your wrist and arrest you, Are You Cool With That?"
1068,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Sooounds great.
1069,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, they just do it."
1070,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, good."
1071,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It is actually, you’re next in the order, it’s your turn."
1072,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, no. I cast Mislead."
1073,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1074,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I turn invisible at the same time as an illusory double of me appears where I’m standing.
1075,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering & clapping],
1076,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I will let the- I will break the laws of D&D to let these two things happen at the exact same time.
1077,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, What- what do you mean?
1078,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It wasn’t your turn but it can definitely be your turn.
1079,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, You said it was my turn.
1080,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It’s your turn now, yeah. But they arrested you on their turn."
1081,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," They arrested me, that’s their turn, I didn’t want to raise suspicions. "
1082,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1083,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," So, Mislead. And then I get the Umbra Staff up. Open. It has feather fall in it- I jump off the catwalk, onto the guy that currently has Magnus pinned."
1084,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1085,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah. Are you, are you―"
1086,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," But here, okay, here’s the other thing the other―"
1087,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience chanting Taako’s name],
1088,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," The other small note of this, is that I can make it gesture [Griffin laughs], speak, and behave in whatever way I choose."
1089,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So now you are playing fake-Taako-who-has-been-arrested, and invisible-Taako-in-the-ring?"
1090,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Right.
1091,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, How long are you invisible?
1092,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Up to an hour.
1093,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, This spell is OP. Okay.
1094,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," It’s a good spell! But I can’t direct- Okay, I can also see through his eyes and use his senses."
1095,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah.
1096,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, But I become blind and deaf in my meat-form when I’m in spirit.
1097,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So you just launched your body into like, darkness without seeing like, where you were going if your invisible form is the one that can’t see or hear?"
1098,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," But I’m- no, I choose at will."
1099,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1100,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, And right now I want to see the guys jumping on the guy.
1101,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah you see the guys jumping on the guy. Yeah, you land on Moonbeam and knock him off, saving Magnus from the pin he just―"
1102,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Perfect. And then I get the hell out of the ring.
1103,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah, you probably had a little bit of move action."
1104,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Arcane eye is still active, I still have an overhead view of the ring. And now I’m prob- I’m just cruis―"
1105,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Jesus, okay, so you’ve got like a fucking full blown like picture in picture―"
1106,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I’ve got a fucking snake eyes style security network, like, fucking, I’ve got my eyes in the Gary, I’ve got-- or Je-what’s his name? Greg, I’ve got my eyes in the Greg. Greg eyes up. I’ve got Arcane Eye. And then I’m cruising, I’m just patrolling around, walking around―"
1107,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Here’s what I’ll―
1108,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You’re like Jesus or something.
1109,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," With your floating eye then, I will say this after you jump down, you see a shape up on the catwalk that was standing basically right next to you, before you jumped down, that was wearing a Chameleon Cloak that was sort of hiding them. They don’t see your floating eyeball, so they kinda poke their head out, and you see a figure up on the catwalk that you just jumped down from."
1110,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Great, okay."
1111,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Probably fine. [audience laughter]
1112,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," But my turn’s gotta be over as hell by now, right."
1113,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Your turn is super duper over.
1114,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, yeah."
1115,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I also wanna make clear, you two do not know about this figure at all."
1116,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s fine.
1117,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Cool.
1118,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Merle, you’re next."
1119,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I don’t even know what the hell we’re talking about anymore.
1120,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Great! Merle it’s your turn. Merle, actually, before you go, Jess, who is like, still like, just her and Sabine are just like, having a Punch! Jess, mid-punch, she’s like turns to you and points down at the ring and like points like, she’s pointing under it like,"
1121,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," [subtle whispering] Look under the ring, under the ri―"
1122,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She’s mouthing,"
1123,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, [subtle whispering] Under the riiiING.
1124,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And she’s pointing at her ass like that?
1125,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Nope.
1126,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Does she need one of those hemorrhoid cushions?
1127,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And it’s your turn.
1128,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," [beat] Oh, you said no hemorrhoid jokes. I forgot, I’m sorry. In pre-show prep. I forgot that."
1129,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," What’s your- what are you going to do on your turn, in the game, Dungeons and Dragons?"
1130,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I’m gonna go look under the ring!
1131,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yaaayyyyy!
1132,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah.
1133,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Roll a d20 for me.
1134,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay.
1135,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yep.
1136,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience Member, Do you know which one that is!?
1137,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, He got it.
1138,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Ohh, sick fucking burn from the crowd!"
1139,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," C’mon, let’s go! C’mon!"
1140,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1141,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Sit down dad, it’s not worth it."
1142,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, My arm fell off.
1143,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1144,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, He actually has a caddy―
1145,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, My arm fell off.
1146,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," And this caddy has each one labeled so,"
1147,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, We’ll be selling these in the lobby after the show.
1148,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, WE WON’T.
1149,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, We won’t! You liar.
1150,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Guys this, it’s pre-marketing."
1151,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," It’s not, it’s lies."
1152,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Pre-marketing for non-existent products!
1153,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, (slightly exasperated) Please roll the dice.
1154,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Clinton!
1155,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," He rolled it, he got a 15."
1156,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, 15! What am I adding to it?
1157,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay for a fift-- Nothing, it’s just a roll to see what you pull out from underneath- this is kind of like a Fantasy Gachapon of its own. "
1158,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience woo-ing],
1159,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I have a table―
1160,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And I get to keep it, right?"
1161,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It is a big metal ladder, is what you pull out from under. I’m also going to say that doesn’t count as your action. Now you have a big metal ladder and―"
1162,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, What kind of magic does it have?
1163,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The- It can get you up higher? Levitation, but like, a super efficient form of Levitation?"
1164,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, alright. How high is it? How tall?"
1165,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, 8 feet.
1166,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Have you watched wrestling, ever?"
1167,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I watch Olympic Wrestling. I watch Greco-Roman wrestling.
1168,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I will say―
1169,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Wait, hold on. (in a high-pitched incredulous voice) Do you?"
1170,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, (in the same tone of voice) Nooo.
1171,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Oohkay.
1172,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I will say this―
1173,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, super quick. Raise your hand if you’ve ever wrestled for a sport. Okay, there we go, that’s Travis."
1174,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," (loudly) I was a, (in a normal tone) oh you were, weren’t you."
1175,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yes I was.
1176,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I went to every wrestling match he did.
1177,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And watched me lose every time!
1178,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, He lost every match! The one time I didn’t go―
1179,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, we don’t have to tell this story."
1180,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, The one time I didn’t go [beat]
1181,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I beat a kid with the flu.
1182,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, He beat a kid with the flu.
1183,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It was the one time I ever won at wrestling.
1184,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering & laughing],
1185,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The things you pull out from under the ring can be used for whatever you want, they can also be used as improvised weapons. That’s what the stuff under the ring exists for."
1186,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," You’re really leading me down the path here, aren’t ya."
1187,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Nah, I’m saying do whatever you want you have an improvised weapon or you can use it to get up high and change a lightbulb or… [audience laughter]"
1188,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Alright! I take the magic ladder, with all the powers it has, and I hit [beat] somebody with it."
1189,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Which one?! 
1190,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, (off mic) Shit!
1191,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Jeff Angel, Moonbeam, or Death Man."
1192,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, (uncertainly) De- The m-moon Jeff.. being deathblown-
1193,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, He moons Jeff!
1194,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Oh, you know what? Moon Jeff is an acceptable answer, because of your ingenuity, it’s long enough you could probably hit two of these boys with it."
1195,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[cheering],
1196,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," I knoww, Griffin. I hit [beat] Moon and Jeff."
1197,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, roll your d20. "
1198,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [unintelligible]
1199,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Plus seven, it’s a plus seven!"
1200,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, So that’d be 20!! I hit him with a 20.
1201,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay yeah, that’ll hit both of them. Roll one d12, the twelve-sided  one."
1202,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, schnickey."
1203,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, you got it. He can do it."
1204,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1205,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I feel like I oughta be taking them out of a little silk purse and a fly comes outta it. 
1206,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Okay, move it along."
1207,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Here comes a twelve. 
1208,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It’s a 12.
1209,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s... a 12!
1210,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Nice, okay."
1211,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," [laughing, audience cheers] Damn, I’m good at this game."
1212,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So, actually, what you did, to make it clear, you threw it at Moonbeam and it also hit the invisible Jeff Angel, knocking him out of invisibility."
1213,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Did I kill ‘im?
1214,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, but―"
1215,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," (hushed, to himself) Shit."
1216,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," ―Moonbeam looks bad off. Next in the order is Jess and Sabine, and I think Jess actually manages to get one over on Sabine and has her pinned. Next in the order is Magnus."
1217,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m gonna pick up that ladder.
1218,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Nice.
1219,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Thank you. And I’m just gonna two-handed swing it at ol’ Moonbeam.
1220,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1221,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[isolated, single audience member clap] ",
1222,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Thank you.
1223,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, The ol’ ladder bash.
1224,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Uhh.. oh, that’s not gonna do it―"
1225,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Boy, this being-honest stuff is not working for you."
1226,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Well, I’m not using my good dice, where’s my good die? There we go. "
1227,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Yeah, roll―"
1228,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," So that was a 4, "
1229,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Roll the dice that doesn’t have a four on it―
1230,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, ―and that doesn’t do it. But now I’m gonna backhand swing for my second attack.
1231,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1232,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [laughing]
1233,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," [beat] That’s not any better, that’s a 6."
1234,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So many whiffs! No, no, no, and no."
1235,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Perfect. I’m now going to use Cunning Action. [audience member cheers] Thank you. To get away.
1236,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. Where you going?
1237,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Uuhmmm. I’m actually going to get on the other side of Jess so that she’s flanking Sabine.
1238,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, that’s fine."
1239,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’ve still got the ladder in my hand.
1240,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, That’s fine.
1241,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I hold it in front of me like a shield.
1242,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Magnus, make a dexterity saving throw for me."
1243,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," That’s a thirteen plus two, 15?"
1244,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, you- as you are making that action a dart flies by your neck, just missing you by an inch, and sticks into the ring, and you see it stick into the ring and then it vanishes in a puff of black smoke."
1245,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Was it Jeff Angel?
1246,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, it didn’t come from anybody in the crowd or in the ring."
1247,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Can I do a quick perception check to see if I can tell where it came from?
1248,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1249,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s a thirteeeeeEEEN.... Yep.
1250,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It came from above.
1251,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1252,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Next in the order is―
1253,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I look at Merle and I just point to the catwalk.
1254,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Next in the order is Death Man? Who’s actually gonna run over and try to stop Jess from pinning Sabine. And that’s a 2, so he’s just like,"
1255,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Death Man, Cut it out!
1256,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You bad lady!
1257,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then Jeff, I think, is going to spread his beautiful white wings and fly up in the air and then come diving down with a kick on you, Magnus."
1258,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Okay.
1259,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he rolls a 22 versus AC, that’s probably gonna do it."
1260,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That is gonna a hit.
1261,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Now, he does have the ladder held up in front of him as a shield."
1262,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, That’s only 9 points of damage.
1263,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, it’s still gonna hit. What?"
1264,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, 9 damage. Please don’t do anything else to―
1265,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah it’s fine.
1266,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Moonbeam is up next, and what Moonbeam does is really interesting."
1267,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, He cries.
1268,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Because he looks like he’s about to run at you, Magnus, and then he stops. And he sniffs and he goes, [sniffing sounds], and he looks around the ring, and he looks directly at you, Taako,"
1269,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Holy shit!
1270,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he runs over to you Taako, and grabs you? And as soon as he does, your invisibility wears off, and he picks you up, and he lifts up a claw to come swinging down at you and he goes,"
1271,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Moonbeam, Taako! What the blazes are you doing here?
1272,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, It’s Klaaaaaaaaaaaaarg!!!
1273,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering & clapping],
1274,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he takes―
1275,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," It’s Kelsey Grammer, ladies and gentleman!"
1276,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he takes off his luchador mask, and it is Klaarg, the bugbear."
1277,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, YEAH!!!
1278,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1279,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he says,"
1280,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," As I live and breathe, Taako, my dearest friend! What are you doing here?"
1281,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Well.
1282,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It’s a beautiful reunion.
1283,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," I was invisible. And now I’m not, so thank you for that, that’s good."
1284,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," I’m sorry, I thought I smelled your beautiful musk."
1285,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Clint laughs],
1286,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," And indeed you did, very perceptive."
1287,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," I just want to say, I want to clear the air. The last time we saw each other, you made me jump off of a motorcycle, onto a tank, into a laser beam, and I just want to say, I understand why you had to do that―"
1288,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Sure.
1289,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, ―and I’m not angry.
1290,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Uhhhh. It’s good to see you.
1291,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, It’s very good to see you.
1292,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," I, I uhm."
1293,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," I have a new tea backstage I’m very excited about, I think you’re going to love it."
1294,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," First off, let’s say the obvious I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to try and kill ya."
1295,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, That was really sweet. I have something I also want to―
1296,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then he- you hear like a BZZZT, and he goes rigid."
1297,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Son of a bitch.
1298,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And then he fucking suplexes you.
1299,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience crying out ‘Noo’],
1300,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Nooooo.
1301,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I actually think he grabs you and jumps off the top rope with crazy bugbear acrobatics and jumps like, ten feet in the air and suplexes you. And that’s a 24."
1302,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience groaning],
1303,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Let me see, let me check my AC."
1304,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1305,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I’m gonna force disadvantage because I said I was wielding as a shield, and I’m gonna use my protector thing to make him have to roll again."
1306,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I don’t think you were within five feet of him.
1307,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, How big is the fuckin’ hexagon!
1308,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," It’s big, it’s a, y’know, it’s big."
1309,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter then some scattered boos],
1310,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah, no, I’ll roll it again. [laughs] How about a 21? Does that still get there?"
1311,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," That’s a hit, yes."
1312,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He does this insane, like, diving suplex and you get hit for 28 points of damage."
1313,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience ‘Ohhh’-ing],
1314,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[beat],
1315,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[scattered laughter],
1316,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," That’s bad, right?"
1317,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Not great.
1318,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And you are prone. And he says,"
1319,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," (in a deeper, angrier tone) You made me jump off of a motorcycle, onto a tank, and get shot by a laser!"
1320,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," [beat] True. Guilty-- listen, listen, listen Taako earned that one. That’s a- I’ll grant you that suplex for free. Don’t do it again, I will literally die."
1321,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think the security guards are next, do we play out what―"
1322,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [laughing]
1323,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, ―fake Taako does?
1324,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Well, okay, here’s the only problem, I need- No, we can’t because I need a bonus―"
1325,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think the- actually the spell’s broken, probably, when he shook you out of the invisibility?"
1326,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," He got me out of the invisibility, didn’t break the other guy, but I need to use a bonus action to be able to switch my awareness, so I wouldn’t see what that..."
1327,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, we’ll then-- they’re just like―"
1328,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," But he is- The thing about him though, the programming I left him with, he is chattering incessantly and saying the most banal, like, state-of-the-world things. So literally, every word out of his mouth, constantly, because I didn’t teach him how to listen, is just like,"
1329,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dummy Taako," (as Tuff Greg) So! Crazy weather we’re having, huh? That’s how Greg sees it anyway! You guys going to the Padres game later?"
1330,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Guard NPC," No like, stop, wait, hold on, we have to ask you questions about how you broke through our security―"
1331,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Dummy Taako," (as Tuff Greg) No, no, no, listen, I love being here with you guys, this is great! You got any SOH-DA?"
1332,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Every time Greg says soda, that’s how he says it."
1333,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Taako you’re actually up next- whoa―
1334,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[Assuming their reactions, the house lights or lights came on, showing the rest of the crowd]",
1335,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Hello everybody.
1336,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Hi everybody.
1337,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Ha ha, oh MY GOD! THEY’RE OUT THERE! "
1338,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Okay.
1339,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Taako, you’re up next. You got, uh, uhh. Sabine’s about to pin somebody―"
1340,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, I thought Jess had Sabine."
1341,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, Jess has Sabine, sorry, Jess is about to pin Sabine. You got three other fighters, and you have a dart that just came at Magnus from the catwalk."
1342,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, I cast Cloud Kill. That’s a cool name, right?"
1343,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What the fuck?
1344,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, so check this heat. I created a 20 foot radius sphere of poison- this is at the center of the catwalk [clicks tongue]. You create a 20 foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range."
1345,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"The fog spreads around corners, it lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog (good luck indoors) ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured, so cheese it with the knives. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on or on a turn, it starts its turn there. The creature must make a constitution saving throw and, uhh. Well, we should start with that.",
1346,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1347,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Still, again, let me remind you―"
1348,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Oh my god!
1349,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, ―there’s a bunch of people underneath this!
1350,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Yeah, but it’s a 20 foot sphere. It’s a 20, folks!"
1351,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, No that’s a 1!
1352,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," That’s a 1, actually, on that one. So that’s a critical failure."
1353,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, yeah, no, this.."
1354,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I failed as hell, so now it’s going to take five d8 poison damage."
1355,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Holy shit.
1356,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience ‘Ohh’-ing & cheering],
1357,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Uhhm, Okay, uhh, okay good. They’re affected even if they hold their breaths, so let’s see what we got here. Four. Six, 10. Seven,"
1358,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, 17.
1359,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, 17.
1360,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Five,"
1361,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis and Clint, 22.
1362,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Wow, show-offs!"
1363,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Two.
1364,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, 24.
1365,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Is that all, is that five?"
1366,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yes.
1367,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Was that five?
1368,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yes.
1369,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Okay.
1370,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What was the total?
1371,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, What?
1372,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," One more, apparently, everybody’s saying one more."
1373,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, One more. That’s a seven.
1374,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1375,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, 31.
1376,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I point at the sky and say,"
1377,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, I got that fart touch!
1378,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, And then emit a Cloud Kill―
1379,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Alright.
1380,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, ―into the air.
1381,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think in the interest of moving things along the, this shadowy figure goes next and you hear a,"
1382,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure, Augh!
1383,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, As they get this bad bad poison damage and then they cast Gust of Wind to push the poison cloud directly downward into the ring.
1384,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Hell yeah!
1385,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience exclaiming “oh”s],
1386,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, I need everybody to make a constitution saving throw.
1387,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Ohh yeahh. [beat] Ohh noo...
1388,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[laughter],
1389,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I rolled a 13, or I got a 13."
1390,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Oh my god.
1391,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Clint rolls],
1392,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Ohhh no.
1393,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Ohh my god.
1394,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I rolled a... 6…
1395,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Holy shit, this is gonna hit everybody! Holy shit, IT HIT EVERYBODY."
1396,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter & clapping],
1397,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, How’d you do Taako?
1398,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, 13.
1399,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, IT HIT FUCKING EVERYBODY.
1400,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Smooth move Ex Lax.
1401,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, I tried my best.
1402,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," One- how many is it, five d8?"
1403,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah.
1404,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, One. That’s seven. Holy shi―
1405,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[indiscernible audience member],
1406,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You can’t- I’m trying to add things. What? Oh yeah, dwarves are- have something―"
1407,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Thank you, that one time tonight, but not again. You have advantage against poisoning, roll again."
1408,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Yeahh! Oh yeah, I do. Ohh, thank you Jesus. [beat] 19!"
1409,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1410,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, But just that one time!
1411,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, But never do that again.
1412,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Okay.
1413,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. So it’s 20 points of damage.
1414,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s nothing to me. 
1415,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Ha!
1416,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I take 20 points of damage when I eat my breakfast.
1417,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Wait a minute, do I take 20 points of damage?"
1418,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, No.
1419,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Oh guys, you don’t want me to be the last one standing."
1420,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, No you’re fine.
1421,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," We actually do, you’re the cleric!"
1422,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, What does that mean?
1423,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1424,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, How’s Taako?
1425,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, He’s alright.
1426,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Is that like, an accountant?"
1427,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Are we about to have a Taako-death, like, time paradox situation on our hands?"
1428,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Nah, I’m good."
1429,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay. I think with that, ‘cause we have been going for, like an hour and a half now?"
1430,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeahh.
1431,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," That takes out a few folks. I think Sabine gets pinned. I think Jess takes quite a bit of damage but she is still up. Death Man goes down- actually, no, Death Man is fine, Jeff goes down and―"
1432,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience ‘awhh’-ing],
1433,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah...
1434,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, FUCK JEFF!
1435,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"[audience laughter, one going “BOO JEFF”]",
1436,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You wouldn’t buy his action figure and now you all love him!
1437,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So this happens and you feel a quake happen throughout the crowd as this happens and everybody’s just like, running off because now they’re terrified of this poison cloud that has descended upon the ring and nearly killed everybody."
1438,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"And that figure falls off the catwalk, into the ring, and you see a woman with short red hair wearing that Chameleon Robe, and she has like a, bandolier with those darts on and she’s got a staff. And she falls down and helps herself up and says,",
1439,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure," (winded) I don’t know, which one of you is working with Garrigos, but I don’t have time to wait anymore and figure it out."
1440,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, It’s him.
1441,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She looks at you, Taako, and says,"
1442,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure, You. Powerful wizard.
1443,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Euhh.
1444,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure, Master wizard.
1445,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, (giggles)
1446,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure, Are you an acolyte?
1447,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, (tittering laughter) What?
1448,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure, Are you an acolyte of Garrigos?
1449,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Say yes. Say yes.
1450,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Yes...?
1451,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Yes.
1452,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," No, no!"
1453,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, No! I’m―
1454,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Don’t ever listen to dad!
1455,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," I’m but a, uh, uh, humble cooking wizard whose ratings are bound to improve if people start dying on this show."
1456,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, The Voidfish is gonna have its work cut out for it making everybody forget this shit.
1457,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
1458,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Cloaked Figure," My name is Marie. I’m a magus of the Order of Tempus, the war god? But see, like, my war god- let me explain some stuff."
1459,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Okay.
1460,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, [laughs]
1461,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," Tempus is a war god of honorable battle, and Garrigos is an old, long forgotten god who is the patron of raiders and wanton violence―"
1462,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Oh, that would be us."
1463,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie, ―and I received a missive that an ancient cell of the Cult of Garrigos survived and was operating out of Neverwinter and I tracked them to this place- to the Chaos Theatre.
1464,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And she takes a dart and throws it at one of those banners that had been hanging from the walls and you actually see, I think, Merle, you’d recognize it-- actually, make a religion roll for me. Merle, maybe-- yours is more of an earthy religion? I don’t know if you―"
1465,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Sure!
1466,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, ―how well read you are.
1467,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, The d20.
1468,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Twelve plus religion, four- "
1469,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, yeah that’s enough."
1470,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, 16!
1471,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You see the sigil that is hidden underneath this banner, it is five arms that are sort of folded in a circle and they’re all holding scimitars, and that is the sigil of Garrigos and you realize that this is―"
1472,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Carey are you writing this down?
1473,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, For the fanart later?
1474,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Write this down, Carey―"
1475,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You can’t ask people―
1476,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, ―cause that’ll be awesome.
1477,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience member whoo-ing],
1478,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," This place, this old building is actually an old temple of Garrigos that has been―"
1479,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Who planned this shit? [beat] [gasps] Oh, it’s humanman!"
1480,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And there is- after this one act of, let’s call it what it is wanton violence, as this poison cloud descends upon the ring, Marie explains that,"
1481,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," This match, the Supreme Champion Finals, this represents a ritual of revival that is supposed to bring back the avatar of Garrigos from the realm of banishment, where a wanton marauder would slay the four champions of the land. Sound familiar? Yeah, I think we’re in some real bad stuff. I don’t know why my voice got so much deeper all of the sudden."
1482,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, (in a deep voice) Yeahhh.
1483,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m Jess now!
1484,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," I took out Brock Thickstone because he was involved and I was trying to figure out who was here and it got really confusing who else was a co-conspirator, but uh, fast forwarding through a lot of plot because this fight took much longer than Griffin thought it would."
1485,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1486,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, (makes really bad fast-forwarding sounds)
1487,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh no, he’s had a stroke!"
1488,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Let’s fast forward to the end of the fight. So there is a―
1489,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, We win!
1490,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, The end.
1491,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No no, you have not won. There is a tremor after this cloud came down and it’s been kind of steady as she explained her situation and the ritual of resurrection just happens. It’s not a lengthy process, all of a sudden-- you don’t even see them appear, it’s like they’ve been there for an eternity but in a different plane. There are five humongous, blood-red arms with these massive hands- these massive, clawed hands- all reaching upward and kind of slamming the ground. They’re all popping out from different points of the ring, on the outsides of the ring. And they’re trying to pull a body out of the depths."
1492,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,"And the crowd has scattered, one of the pillars actually falls inward to the crowd, which is mostly evacuated at this point, but it lands. And when it lands you actually see a few chairs away from it, you see Angus, who’s like holding a big pretzel―",
1493,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Oh please-
1494,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I don’t―
1495,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, pleeease."
1496,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I want you to know, Magnus is not even hesitating- takes off to grabs Angus."
1497,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, No. Noo.
1498,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, That’s good. So this pillar falls and he’s just holding a big pretzel―
1499,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I spring off of the ropes to grab him.
1500,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he’s wearing a Jeff Angel t-shirt.
1501,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience makes scandalized groaning],
1502,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," I still grab him but I rip the t-shirt as I do, and I whisper in his ear,"
1503,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Fuck your t-shirt.
1504,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, So you’ve just torn the clothes off this small boy!?!
1505,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, A great look. At any time.
1506,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And the crowd has scattered except for one figure who is sitting in a big comfy-looking chair behind the announcer’s table. You see Merrick, the CEO of Battlefest who draws a small dagger from a hidden sheath and he drags it across his stomach."
1507,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience groaning],
1508,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," But he’s not cutting his belly open! He’s just cutting open his robe and a giant, dark orb emerges from it."
1509,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1510,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And the orb is glowing a bright red with a swirling crimson cloud suspended within and he’s laughing with malice, but also with kind of, like, relief, because his plan just came together?"
1511,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, You know.
1512,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Like you do.
1513,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, We’ve all been there.
1514,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah.
1515,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, When your plan comes together and you just sit there and go [laughs]
1516,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Jess, who is still standing, grabs Sabine and grabs Jeff Angel and like, drags them up the ramp and is like,"
1517,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess, You guys got this!
1518,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Death Man just like, runs away."
1519,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, NICE.
1520,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," So it’s just you, in the ring-- this will complicate things-- with a still-very-angry Klaarg, and Merrick off to the side holding this orb. Magnus, actually, you’re in the stands with Angus just sort of running around, and we’ll get back into it. I guess we’ll start with top of order."
1521,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Well, I did something while that was― I want to do- take an action while that happens, I didn’t want to interrupt you."
1522,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," In fact I think actually, we’re running so late on time, let’s just drop initiative and just like, if you want to do something in this scene let’s just fucking do it."
1523,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Okay.
1524,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1525,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," The first thing I’m going to do is reach into my cloak and pull from my cloak a small, exquisite chest. And then I pick up that chest and I throw it to the ground-- a chest also exquisite, but larger, emerges from another dimension―"
1526,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Is this like those russian dolls?
1527,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, A matryoshka.
1528,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, ―pops open and everyone’s weapon’s in it.
1529,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," Come eat. Everybody come get some, come get a taste!"
1530,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay you are re-armed. Merle, I think you reach into the chest and just fling the ax at Magnus to catch it―"
1531,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, While he’s doing that I throw Angus into the ring.
1532,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1533,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, And the ax hits him!!
1534,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I’m getting him out of harm's way!
1535,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, The ax cuts him in half!
1536,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, ‘s fine.
1537,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience whooping],
1538,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, It’s beautiful.
1539,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s like 4.99 on Amazon. That was it.
1540,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Taako, one of the giant hands reaches down and slaps you for 8 points of damage."
1541,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Okay. I cast- is it my- I cast Bigby’s Hand.
1542,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You did kind of just go.
1543,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Well I know, but you just said―"
1544,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," No, you want this to happen."
1545,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. 
1546,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," You did say- he slaps me and I create a large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space. My hand is an object, that has AC 20 and hit points equal to my hit point maximum and it has its strength of 26, +8, and dexterity of 10, and I smack that fucker right back."
1547,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1548,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Come onnn. Say it! Say it!
1549,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, No.
1550,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Say it, pleaseee."
1551,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, No!
1552,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Please, say it for daddy."
1553,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Let him say it.
1554,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Abracafuck you!
1555,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeaaahhhh!!!!!
1556,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[loud cheers from audience],
1557,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I think you don’t even roll. I think you just fucking, astrally high five this thing so hard, this arm just explodes and you hear from below you, you hear a really angry, deep voiced scream."
1558,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, good."
1559,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You guys want to do anything?
1560,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah I do. I’m gonna start charging up these stands towards Merrick to two-handed attack him.
1561,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1562,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," And I want to do it as like, a jumping attack, y’know what I mean?"
1563,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1564,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Great. I just do it?
1565,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, roll d20."
1566,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Oh, okay. [beat] I’ll take that, that’s- because I have Railsplitter back, plus nine, is 21?"
1567,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Yeah that’s definitely good enough.
1568,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Super quick, just sidenote, I just have one hitpoint left so if anything happens to- let’s keep an eye on cha’ boy, okay?"
1569,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I do―
1570,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Was that directed at me?
1571,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Just everybody—
1572,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, And I do eleven points of damage.
1573,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Generally speaking, I have one hitpoint."
1574,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, What’d you do?
1575,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Eleven points of damage.
1576,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, that does not kill Merrick but it is enough to send the orb flying up and into the air and it looks like it’s about to fall and it just kind of bounces as it lands- like it doesn’t shatter- and it bounces really really high up and a spectral hand appears and grabs it out of the air."
1577,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I hit it with my ladder for the second attack of my action.
1578,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience whoops],
1579,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay. What are you hitting?
1580,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, The orb.
1581,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Okay.
1582,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, What would that be a check of? Just a ladder attack? [laughs]
1583,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1584,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That would end up being a 15.
1585,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, that’s fine. You see Merrick reach out and you see this red Mage Hand reach out to try to grab the orb as it flies away from him and you just kind of smack it away from him and it’s flying far away and then you see a blue Mage Hand appear and grab it out of the air and suck it back to the ring and Angus is holding it―"
1586,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, YeaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!
1587,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And he’s holding his wand out.
1588,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," THAT’S MY BOY! THAT’S MY BOY!! MY BEAUTIFUL, MAGIC BOY!"
1589,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering & clapping],
1590,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
1591,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, WHAT DO I DOOO?
1592,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he’s like, running around the ring as these four―"
1593,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Angus! Keep away!
1594,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, What does that mean??
1595,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Just like we do with you with your books.
1596,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter],
1597,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Okay, Merle, Merle make a- he throws the ball at you, make a dexterity throw."
1598,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," A dexterity, okay."
1599,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Doing great.
1600,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Roll a d20.
1601,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay.
1602,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Don’t break the mo.
1603,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, It’s uhhhhhhhh―
1604,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Eleven?
1605,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, ―hhhhheleveeeeeeen
1606,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Eleven.
1607,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," And- no, I have a zero modifier."
1608,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis," Yeah, eleven."
1609,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Zero, it’s eleven."
1610,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah that’s good- it’s kind of clumsy but you manage to catch it with one hand and all of a sudden these four hands are now slapping towards you as you hold this orb, what do you do?"
1611,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," Oh, well."
1612,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Give it to―
1613,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint," You have one- shouldn’t I, shouldn’t I heal him?"
1614,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience ‘YEAHHH’-ing],
1615,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Why start now?
1616,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Can he toss it as a free action?
1617,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, I think so."
1618,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Toss it to the guy with the fork.
1619,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[beat],
1620,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1621,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Ohhhhhhh. 
1622,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Now...
1623,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Hold on. No no no no. This orb is so big, there is absolutely no way I’m going to let this happen."
1624,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, That’s what I thought when he took the Blazin’ Challenge at BW Three’s but he still did it.
1625,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, No.
1626,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, That’s a true story that I’ll tell you all about later.
1627,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Merle what are you doing?
1628,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I look at him, and I, as a free action say,"
1629,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," I can’t die. Literally, I can’t die! Don’t worry about me, I live longer than this!"
1630,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The magus woman says,"
1631,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," Throw it to me, throw it to me, trust me."
1632,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I toss it to Marie.
1633,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, She catches it and she holds it in her hand for a second―
1634,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, And then she eats it.
1635,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And she says,"
1636,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, You should have eaten this stuff! This is delicious! You guys fucked up.
1637,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
1638,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," Magnus, I uh.. I really like your costume it looks really cool, and I like your character and I think it’s really well-developed out."
1639,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And as she says that the orb starts to glow a little bit less and the hands kind of recoil in pain, "
1640,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," Oh, I see."
1641,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, and then she tosses it to Taako.
1642,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay.
1643,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She says,"
1644,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie," You don’t understand! Wanton violence and destruction is what summons Garrigos, the only thing that can put him back in the realm of banishment is the opposite of that."
1645,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, We can do violence!
1646,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako," No, I can do this! [beat] All the spells I cast tonight worked super good and they were really dope and it was awesome!"
1647,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Nothing happens.
1648,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, Nothing happens.
1649,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience laughter & clapping],
1650,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Toss me the orb―
1651,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Angus! That was fucking great.
1652,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He says,"
1653,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Angus, Thank you sir. It’s nice to- it’s nice to get positive reinforcement from you for literally the first time ever in my life.
1654,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Don’t get used to it.
1655,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And as you say that the hands ceasing the, sensing the huge―"
1656,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, What a sacrifice it was?? [cracking up]
1657,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," ―what a huge sacrifice that was, the hands actually recoil a lot and the ball is now glowing half as bright as it was before."
1658,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Pass me the rock!
1659,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Actually, Taako... Oh that’s only a 9. You’re probably good. Okay, yeah, one swings at you and you just kind of jump out the way."
1660,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," I do have to pee so if I need to die, it’s fine."
1661,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Pass that rock, actually, we’re almost―"
1662,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Do I- Can I heal his ass?
1663,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," It’s a waste of energy, I don’t die! Like cause we live- okay, so we’re doing a story right now, and it takes place after this story and I’m in it, so like... I can’t die."
1664,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, You died like seven times in the last month.
1665,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Marie yells,"
1666,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Marie, Pass the rock! Pass the rock! Pass the rock!
1667,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Okay, I pass it to Magnus."
1668,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Alright. Do I just catch it?
1669,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Yeah, you got it."
1670,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Okay.
1671,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus," It’s been a pleasure fighting with you, Klaarg. You are a worthy opponent."
1672,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He is like furious right now when you say that to him? He's like,"
1673,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," Yeah, I know. I'm huge and big you've almost killed me like six times just doing things you want me to do."
1674,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, But I also know that you have a good heart.
1675,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," I don't. I promise, I'm a big- I'm a bit-"
1676,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle," Ohh, I see what we're doing."
1677,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," He stands up, he gets rigid again he goes,"
1678,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," Thank you, Magnus. I really wanted to hear that."
1679,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I throw him the rock.
1680,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, He grabs the rock and he says―
1681,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, What do you think about me?
1682,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, Since the day the three of you came into my lives
1683,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, (starts humming-singing)
1684,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, I have been enriched in a way that I- AAHHHH
1685,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Fuck!
1686,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And he stands up rigid again and he goes, (laughs) I think he just goes to attack Taako, actually, while holding this rock."
1687,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Wait a- I haven’t healed him yet!
1688,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, 11? Versus AC.
1689,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, I got 13.
1690,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheers],
1691,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Alright, but he is still holding this orb. And these hands look like they’re maybe regenerating a little bit. What do you do to get the orb away from him?"
1692,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin," Dad, cast something."
1693,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Okay. I cast.. Zone of Tr...
1694,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1695,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, I love it!"
1696,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah.
1697,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I love it, I love it, I love it."
1698,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, No no no! Clinton!
1699,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," No, do it! Do that shit!"
1700,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, I cast Zone of Truth!
1701,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[cheers and applause],
1702,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," You cast Zone of Truth and Klaarg still in like rage mode is just like,"
1703,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," (takes a deep breath) I just love you guys so much! [applause, cheers] I’ve never had a friend before and I know that you’ve taken advantage of me a lot but I can also sense the good in you and I just want to say, I think you’re the best dudes I’ve ever met and do you want to go take a trip to Aspen with me?"
1704,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, Actually that sounds great.
1705,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, My dad has a cabin in Fantasy Aspen and I think we’d have a really great weekend there together. 
1706,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Your face is beet red right now.
1707,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," I know. I’ve been screaming for a while. As he's, as he's—"
1708,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, So what happens to the orb? 
1709,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," The orb is just like dimming and dimming and the arms are just shrivelling up and receding back into the ground and I think as he just goes on and on, and actually it was sweet at first but then it gets maybe a little bit uncomfortable? He goes on and on, and then finally the hands just disappear in a puff of red smoke."
1710,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Justin, You saved the day!!
1711,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, [yelling] I saved the day!!!
1712,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering and clapping],
1713,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Audience Member," We love you, Merle!!"
1714,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, God bless Zone of Truth! [beat] Pan bless Zone of Truth.
1715,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Klaarg is just standing there holding this orb and it turns to black smoke in his hands. And he’s just standing there and he’s like,"
1716,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," I just don’t know what to do with you boys, I’ve-"
1717,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[applause],
1718,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, (singing) Here you go again~♪
1719,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[Clint laughs],
1720,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, My man!
1721,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, Yeahhh.
1722,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Check this out―
1723,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, We met a whole family of bugbears down in Lucas what’s-his-face’s lab― they’re totally cool. We saved them. They’re fine. Do you want to go hang out with them?
1724,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg, You telling me my family still wants me back after what―
1725,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Magnus, YES.
1726,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Taako, Hell yeah.
1727,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Merle, Yeahh.
1728,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Klaarg," That’s amazing, thank you for tying up my storyline like this."
1729,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering],
1730,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, [laughing]
1731,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And I think as the last of the red hands sort of disintegrate in the portals they were popping out of shut close and the black orb disappears. I think there’s like a shock wave of force that comes out from the ring that knocks up some popcorn and discarded signs in a whirlwind and a gigantic battle fest supreme champions Finals banner falls from the ceiling slowly like―
1732,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Like the last shot of Jurassic Park?
1733,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, Like Jurassic Park.
1734,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Like Jurassic Park. [roaring]
1735,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, And you hear a heavy metal clunk come from the stage- Oh. One of the hands grabs Merrick and drags him to hell as it goes back to―
1736,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Clint, Yeah. Yeah.
1737,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Merrick just excuses himself.
1738,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, You hear a heavy metal clunk in the middle of the ring and you see the title belt laying there.
1739,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, I Put It On.
1740,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," Well, Jess actually comes up to the stage―"
1741,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, She left.
1742,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And she says, uh,"
1743,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Well, you boys never cease to amaze, that could have gone real south, real fast, thanks for the help. As for the title belt, a duo can compete in the Supreme Champion Finals but only one of them can take home the belt."
1744,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience “Ohh”-ing],
1745,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, As she reaches for it I put my foot down.
1746,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," She actually says,"
1747,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Jess," Yeah, why don’t we fight for it?"
1748,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin," And then I want to fucking like, Rocky II freeze frame like―"
1749,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Travis, Yeah!!!!
1750,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,Griffin, (sings) Bah baba bah.
1751,Live Boston Stunt Spectacular,[audience cheering and clapping],
