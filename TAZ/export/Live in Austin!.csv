7,Live in Austin!,(part of TAZscripts on Tumblr) ,
8,Live in Austin!,"[Intro music fades in, audience cheers.]",
9,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh—
10,Live in Austin!,Clint, Hey!
11,Live in Austin!,Justin," If you were doing a documentary about us. That would be the moment that you just saw, where you’d be like, “And after that, it all went wrong.”"
12,Live in Austin!,Travis," I brought some hard candy that I was gonna like, fling out into the audience."
13,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
14,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, I told him it’s— [crosstalk] "
15,Live in Austin!,Travis, Griffin told me not to do it but it sounds like...
16,Live in Austin!,Griffin," It’s fucking jawbreakers, those would be— those have a ballistic property—"
17,Live in Austin!,Clint, You’ll put an eye out! You’ll put an eye out!
18,Live in Austin!,Griffin, This is probably not allowed. Look at that. [Audience still cheering]
19,Live in Austin!,Clint," Don’t forget the balcony, Travis."
20,Live in Austin!,Justin, [serene] “After Travis blinded an extremely litigious Austinite with his jawbreakers…”
21,Live in Austin!,Travis," That’s gonna be it. I have a lot more, but I’ll just eat those during the show."
22,Live in Austin!,Justin, “It all fell apart after that.”
23,Live in Austin!,Griffin," I wanna thank… Oh, shit."
24,Live in Austin!,"[Cheering, laughter as Clint puts a big bottle of Gatorade on the table]",
25,Live in Austin!,Travis, A good start.
26,Live in Austin!,Clint," Boy, I have no— [unidentifiable] "
27,Live in Austin!,Justin," I hope everybody’s getting psyched, apparently halfway through Dad’s gonna run a fuckin marathon. Just like, blast the electrolytes."
28,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh—
29,Live in Austin!,Justin," ‘What are you doing tonight Clint?’ ‘Uh, podcast and rugby for four hours apparently.’"
30,Live in Austin!,Griffin, I’m glad you guys dressed up for this.
31,Live in Austin!,Travis, I didn’t.
32,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh. I was gonna say, I’m confused why you decided to cosplay as Tingle, Travis Touchdown and M. Bison from the Street Fighter movie."
33,Live in Austin!,Travis, This is Stolen Century Magnus.
34,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
35,Live in Austin!,Travis, He’s kind of a Johnny Storm type.
36,Live in Austin!,Travis, I will have to change glasses though because these are not prescription.
37,Live in Austin!,Justin," Hey, hey, uh, did anybody bring spell cards?"
38,Live in Austin!,"[Laughter, faint YES]",
39,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Did you really?
40,Live in Austin!,Justin, Come on up!
41,Live in Austin!,[Long and loud applause] ,
42,Live in Austin!,Travis, Here.
43,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Sick as hell.
44,Live in Austin!,Travis, [muffled by audience cheering] Do you want some hard candy?
45,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [through laughter] Hold on wait, hold on wait, did anybody bring cleric spell cards?"
46,Live in Austin!,Clint, Did anybody else bring cleric spell cards?...And a hush falls over the room. [A hush actually falls over the room]
47,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s ‘cause no one plays as clerics.
48,Live in Austin!,Justin," That’s from an imaginary world where Dad uses those spells at all, to heal."
49,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Well, we’re gonna have to figure that out as we go, huh?"
50,Live in Austin!,Clint, I’ll just make the shit up as I usually do.
51,Live in Austin!,Travis, Do you guys know what spells Merle has?
52,Live in Austin!,[audience yells Zone of Truth!],
53,Live in Austin!,Travis, Thank you.
54,Live in Austin!,Clint, What was that again?
55,Live in Austin!,[audience yells Zone! of! Truth!],
56,Live in Austin!,Travis," Don’t play into that, he knew exactly what you said."
57,Live in Austin!,Clint," I have an eyepatch, I can’t hear very well…"
58,Live in Austin!,Travis," Get out, M. Bison."
59,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Um.
60,Live in Austin!,Justin," My man, what was your— who brought me the cards, what’s your name? "
61,Live in Austin!,Audience member, Joe.
62,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Joe?
63,Live in Austin!,Justin, Sorry?
64,Live in Austin!,Joe, Joe!
65,Live in Austin!,Justin," Joe, please don’t let me forget to give these back to you, I’ll feel bad forever. [laughter]"
66,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Y’all wanna get started?
67,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yes!
68,Live in Austin!,[cheering],
69,Live in Austin!,Griffin," I’m trying— we’re trying a new thing. Travis got me this soundboard for my birthday, and so I have some music cues, and so like, I’m gonna try and put some music in it, and if it doesn’t go well I’m just gonna stop doing it in the middle of the show. "
70,Live in Austin!,Travis, We also each bought new dice for this show. Griffin and I by choice—
71,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.
72,Live in Austin!,Travis, Dad and Justin because they just didn’t bring ‘em.
73,Live in Austin!,Justin," And I— I let Charlie pick mine, so [shows Hello Kitty dice]"
74,Live in Austin!,[cheering],
75,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Let’s play Dungeons and Dragons.
76,Live in Austin!,Justin, Hell yeah!
77,Live in Austin!,Travis," This is fun, we haven’t played Dungeons and Dragons in a while."
78,Live in Austin!,Justin, I know.
79,Live in Austin!,Griffin," S— Oh shit, we haven’t played Dungeons and Dragons in like, three months."
80,Live in Austin!,Justin," We were having a mini panic attack about it, yeah."
81,Live in Austin!,Clint, No.
82,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So. Uh, the three of you awaken to the sound of a bell chiming nine times. And just now I’m realizing that would’ve been a super good sound to get on my soundboard."
83,Live in Austin!,Clint[?]," Bong, bong, bong, bongbongbongbongbongbongbong."
84,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So, the three of you wake up, and you are in bed in your dorm room, and you throw open the curtains, and it’s just a lovely day outside. You see the Grand Library next door, this big shiny glass cube, and inside you can see students reading and studying and milling about. And you see wagons below, and they’re bringing in hordes of townies who swarm into the school’s main entrance. You see some sort of athletic team running drills on a really well-manicured field across the road. Um, it’s a really busy scene, and it’s one you’re well-accustomed to seeing every morning when you wake up here, at Neverwinter High School."
85,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
86,Live in Austin!,[Persona 4 - Pursuing My True Self plays],
87,Live in Austin!,Clint, Is that our alma mater?
88,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No. Uhhhh, all three of you make a wisdom-saving throw for me."
89,Live in Austin!,[music stops],
90,Live in Austin!,Clint, Which one is that?
91,Live in Austin!,Travis, The 20-sided one.
92,Live in Austin!,Clint, The 20-sided one?
93,Live in Austin!,Travis," Woah, that’s not good! Thanks, new dice, that’s a threeeeee!"
94,Live in Austin!,Justin, 15. [crosstalk]
95,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m dumb!
96,Live in Austin!,Clint," Holy shit, it’s an 18!"
97,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Hey, all right!"
98,Live in Austin!,Travis, Should we switch?
99,Live in Austin!,Clint, Why now?! Why now?
100,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Magnus, it’s another day of high school!"
101,Live in Austin!,Travis, Sounds about right!
102,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, Taako and Merle, you immediately realize something horrible has gone wrong."
103,Live in Austin!,[Laughter],
104,Live in Austin!,Travis," Thanks, new dice."
105,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Do you just wanna take the eyepatch off or?
106,Live in Austin!,Clint, Only when I wanna see.
107,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
108,Live in Austin!,Clint, Well ever since the whole drop-the-Gatorade incident.
109,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Taako and Merle, you remember going to sleep in the real world at "
110,Live in Austin!,"the Bureau of Balance Headquarters and waking up in this weird high school dorm room? You have to, I imagine, clue Magnus into this fact.",
111,Live in Austin!, Magnus, Whaaaaaat?!
112,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, Magnus, I think you were like, [singsong] excited for a new day, got my new Jansport. Got a new binder and it’s... blue! Justin, should we walk off the stage for like, 15 minutes while you shuffle your deck?"
113,Live in Austin!,Justin, Blame Joe!
114,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Joe, why didn’t you have your spellcards sorted in the way—"
115,Live in Austin!,Travis, Joe!
116,Live in Austin!,Justin," Nah nah, you’re good, Joe, thank you."
117,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Before we get started, I wanted to ask, what were the three of you like in high school? Obviously you didn’t go to high school together, or in Neverwinter, but here you are. What is your high school persona like?"
118,Live in Austin!,Travis," I’m gonna give of you a name, Griffin."
119,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
120,Live in Austin!,Travis, And that name is A.C. Slater.
121,Live in Austin!,"[cheers, laughter]",
122,Live in Austin!,Travis, And that stands for Ability Check Slater.
123,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [laughs] Armor Class would work too ‘cuz that’s what AC stands for.
124,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh, that also works!"
125,Live in Austin!,Griffin, But okay.
126,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’ll go as D.C. Slater.
127,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay. Uh, Merle?"
128,Live in Austin!,Clint," Ummmm, this may surprise you, but I got my ass kicked on a regular basis in high school."
129,Live in Austin!,[audience awwws],
130,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oh no…
131,Live in Austin!,Travis, Don’t— this is imaginary!
132,Live in Austin!,Clint, It was very— Oh!
133,Live in Austin!,Travis, Don’t be sad.
134,Live in Austin!,Griffin," It’s imaginary, yeah."
135,Live in Austin!,Clint," Imaginary? Oh, I was the king of the campus."
136,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oh no!
137,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah!
138,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Now it’s got layers of sadness!
139,Live in Austin!,Clint, I uhhh was president of the—
140,Live in Austin!,Travis, World?
141,Live in Austin!,Clint, Chess club world. And I had a great hot rod.
142,Live in Austin!,[Audience yelps in delight],
143,Live in Austin!,Travis, If you know what I mean…
144,Live in Austin!,Griffin, No! Nope!
145,Live in Austin!,Clint, I’m a grandfather!
146,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Taako. What was Taako like in high school?
147,Live in Austin!,Justin," Ummmm, the coolest? One at the school. I think Taako had a devoted following of people—"
148,Live in Austin!,"[Clint laughs, a few audience members squeal]",
149,Live in Austin!,Justin," Not everybody got him, but the people that did were into it."
150,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So it sounds like we have three A.C. Slaters on our hands maybe, a little bit."
151,Live in Austin!,Justin," No, like, I’m more— I’m more like—"
152,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Zack Morris?
153,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah!
154,Live in Austin!,Justin, Like the Decemberists of cool. You know? And Travis is Aerosmith I guess?
155,Live in Austin!,Griffin, All right.
156,Live in Austin!,Travis, Whoa! Don’t you put that on me!
157,Live in Austin!,Justin," This was before The Decemberists were in like, AT&T commercials or whatever. I’m just kiddin’ Decemberists, I love you guys."
158,Live in Austin!,Clint, Who— Who?
159,Live in Austin!,Travis, Are the Decemberists here tonight?
160,Live in Austin!,[Scattered audience members cheer],
161,Live in Austin!,Justin, Yeah they— they said.
162,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Holy shit, that’s a big band!"
163,Live in Austin!,Travis, Don’t woo! Are you the Polyphonic Spree? How many of you are there?!
164,Live in Austin!,Justin, [crosstalk] Did Arcade Fire come out?
165,Live in Austin!,Clint, Who are the Decemberists?
166,Live in Austin!,Travis," Ooh, guhhhh… [crosstalk]"
167,Live in Austin!,Griffin, So— [crosstalk]
168,Live in Austin!,Travis, That one’s not a joke!
169,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So the three of you leave the uh, the dorm room that you share."
170,Live in Austin!,Clint, Aww…
171,Live in Austin!,Griffin," There’s not usually a three-person dorm room, I’m imagining like a Terrace House bedroom situation—"
172,Live in Austin!,[cheering],
173,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You make your way into the dorm’s common room, and it’s quiet in here. First period is about to begin, so most of the students have run off into the classroom building. There’s one student here, though, and he’s sitting on a couch in the middle of the common area with just this big pile of books splayed out in front of him. And he’s reading one of them, he’s drinking this really strong-smelling tea. And as you enter, he turns his bespectacled face towards you and says"
174,Live in Austin!,[Deeper normal Griffin voice]," Hello, sirs."
175,Live in Austin!,"[cheering, laughter]",
176,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Sure enough, you see a high school aged Angus McDonald."
177,Live in Austin!,[more cheering],
178,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And, and he looks—"
179,Live in Austin!,Travis, Super buff!
180,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, he’s gotten yoked. He’s ripped. He’s like, he looks like he’s undergone like, four or five growth spurts. He’s about your size, Magnus."
181,Live in Austin!,Travis, Get out!
182,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he says,"
183,Live in Austin!,Angus, You should get a move on. You all are gonna be late for class.
184,Live in Austin!,Travis, Nerd!
185,Live in Austin!,Taako," Angus, what’s uhhh, going on?"
186,Live in Austin!,Angus," What do you mean, sir?"
187,Live in Austin!,Taako," Okay, lemme ask that in a different que— way, uh. Do you think anything weird’s going on?"
188,Live in Austin!,Angus," Uh, you three are running late for class. I don’t—"
189,Live in Austin!,Taako," Alright, thanks, Ango, that’ll do it!"
190,Live in Austin!,Angus," No, tell me, what’s— lemme help you out, what’s the situation? You seem out of sorts."
191,Live in Austin!,Travis," I don’t like this smooth jazz Angus. [imitating voice] Hey, you tell me, what’s wrong?"
192,Live in Austin!,Angus, This is just my voice—
193,Live in Austin!,Justin/Travis, I’m listening.
194,Live in Austin!,Angus, I hit puberty [pronounced poo-ber-dee] and it just happened.
195,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Wait, you hit what?"
196,Live in Austin!,Merle, It’s pronounced poo-BEHR-tee.
197,Live in Austin!,Angus," Sorry. What’s going on, tell me, you seem—"
198,Live in Austin!,Travis," Griffin, I would like to do a strength check to try to take his book away and hold it over his head."
199,Live in Austin!,Griffin, All right. This will be a strength contest.
200,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s nothing. Why are these new dice so bad?
201,Live in Austin!,Griffin, I got a 25. He’s like— [Griffin gestures]
202,Live in Austin!,Clint," Well, he only rolled a 4, so you’ll—"
203,Live in Austin!,Travis," Yeah I got a 8— 9— to be fair, I got a 12."
204,Live in Austin!,Clint, Give him a wedgie!
205,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He dislocates your shoulder when you pull the book away. He says,"
206,Live in Austin!,Angus," What— What’s going on, what’s the matter?"
207,Live in Austin!,Taako, Uhh. Mm.
208,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Well, when last we saw you, you were, uhhh—"
209,Live in Austin!,Merle, A twerp!
210,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Uh, a child?"
211,Live in Austin!,Angus," Okay, I’m… okay."
212,Live in Austin!,Magnus, And we were not.
213,Live in Austin!,Taako," Yeah, we were— we were— we’re grown folk."
214,Live in Austin!,Angus, You’re saying this is some sort of—
215,Live in Austin!,Taako, Exactly.
216,Live in Austin!,Merle, Imbroglio.
217,Live in Austin!,Angus," Well, that sounds like you could be going through any number of things."
218,Live in Austin!,Taako," I mean, probably magic."
219,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Could be a dream?
220,Live in Austin!,Taako, I don’t wanna get too Law & Order here.
221,Live in Austin!,Angus, Have you— have you tried poking through the walls? Maybe it’s just one big illusion?
222,Live in Austin!,Travis, I run at the wall.
223,Live in Austin!,Griffin," It’s a— It’s a hard— It’s a hard, hard wall."
224,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Ow! Not that!
225,Live in Austin!,Angus," You could’ve gone back in time, but did you all—"
226,Live in Austin!,Travis, I try to go forward in time.
227,Live in Austin!,Taako," Well, Ango, if we had gone back in time, you would be younger, or nonexistent. Oh, what a fantasy!"
228,Live in Austin!,Angus," Maybe it’s some sort of parallel dimension? No, that’d be lame. Um… Maybe it could be a dream? But the fact that you all realize something was wrong makes it sound like you’re all in the same dream…"
229,Live in Austin!,Magnus," I didn’t. To be fair, I didn’t. I’m wicked stupid."
230,Live in Austin!,Angus, Okay.
231,Live in Austin!,Justin, Can I just say? The extent to which Angus has bought into this and the speed at which he has bought into this is truly upsetting.
232,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Listen, he’s a—"
233,Live in Austin!,Justin," Like, that is a man whose grasp of reality is like, razor-thin."
234,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He’s an eru— an erudite young man, and he’s quick on his feet who realizes something’s wrong and his entire life in this universe is a lie and a dream. Maybe."
235,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, he’s like, ready to ride it out"
236,Live in Austin!,Travis, It’s possible we’re just all on Salvia.
237,Live in Austin!,[Long pause],
238,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You’ve ruined the Act III twist… He says,"
239,Live in Austin!,Angus, Why don’t you let me look into this.
240,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And he piles up a few books off the table.
241,Live in Austin!,Angus, You should really get to class though. Do you know where you’re going?
242,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh god, this is my dream all over again!"
243,Live in Austin!,Clint, Do we have pants on?
244,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
245,Live in Austin!,Angus," Hey, Brody , can you show ‘em the way?"
246,Live in Austin!,Travis, Who?
247,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, and in the corner— I just heard 12 people in the audience go [disgusted] ‘Brody?’ I’m allowed to do new characters, it doesn’t have to all be fuckin’ callbacks. In the corner you see a young man who, surprisingly you haven’t noticed until now. He’s wearing a bright red T-shirt underneath a bright green nylon jacket with bright blue sleeves. He’s wearing sunglass—"
248,Live in Austin!,[mixed audience reaction of horror and disgust],
249,Live in Austin!,"What was that reaction? He’s wearing sunglasses even though he’s been indoors this entire time, and when Angus mentions his name, he puts down this enormous fucking Stone of Farspeech. Uh, and he sets it down on the table next to him. And—",
250,Live in Austin!,Travis," [crosstalk] Oh, I see."
251,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He tucks it into the pocket of his faded jeans, and this isn’t Barry. Barry’s not the only one that gets to wear blue jeans in this universe. And he skateboards up to you guys from like, six feet away."
252,Live in Austin!,Justin, [gagging noises]
253,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he says uh,"
254,Live in Austin!,Brody," [nasally nerdbro voice] What’s up Tres Horny Boys? You guys ready for another day of boring old school? Ughhckk, homework, riiiight?"
255,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Brody, I’m— I’m gonna stop you right there for just one second, if I could talk to Taako just for a second."
256,Live in Austin!,Justin," Uh, you’re gonna have to talk loud cuz the moment Brody came a-runnin, Taako was like repulsed backwards. Like, like a thirty-foot radius forcefield around Brody,"
257,Live in Austin!,Taako, Noooooooope!
258,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Is it just me, or is this dude the coolest?"
259,Live in Austin!,Merle, [singsong] It’s just youuuuuu.
260,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Fair enough!
261,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He does a kickflip standing still—
262,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Whooooooooaaaaaa!!
263,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
264,Live in Austin!,Brody," Come on, I’ll show you around the classroom building, or as I call it, the cellblock, riiight?"
265,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Whooooooooooooooooaaaaaa!!!
266,Live in Austin!,Justin," Audience, please don’t encourage Brody. "
267,Live in Austin!,[cheering],
268,Live in Austin!,Brody," Brody really needed that, thanks!"
269,Live in Austin!,Griffin, So Brody skates you down the long hallways of the classroom building.
270,Live in Austin!,Travis," Are we like, jogging behind him to keep up? Like [exhausted panting]"
271,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He’s a courteous, uh, skater. He’s going—"
272,Live in Austin!,Clint, He’s going serpentine so we can stay up with him.
273,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He’s going at more of a canter. And the classroom building halls are lined with these windows offering you more spectacular views of the campus outside. But the halls are fairly empty. First period has started and so most of the students here are already tucked away in the various classes that you are passing by here on your skateboard tour. There’s calculus and history and music theory and speech & debate and so on. There are adminis— some speech and debate fans out there.
274,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
275,Live in Austin!,Griffin," There are some administrative rooms, big teacher’s lounge, student council room, an AV room. And from your dorm you entered onto the third floor of the classroom building, and at the far end of this hall is a bridge leading into the practice building. And every few dozens feet or so are vending machines advertising strange potions with fantastical names like Snapple and Fruitopia."
276,Live in Austin!,Travis," Griffin, can I roll to buy a Snapple?"
277,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You don’t have to roll, do you challenge the Snapple machine?"
278,Live in Austin!,Travis," I do, I wanna shake a Snapple loose, I don’t wanna pay for it. "
279,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh, okay. You kind of—"
280,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh, you know what, I’m gonna Fonzie punch it. [crosstalk]"
281,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, of course, look at you."
282,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m gonna Fonz it.
283,Live in Austin!,Justin, Of course.
284,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, of course, look at you."
285,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah! That’s a 19!
286,Live in Austin!,Griffin," That’s your roll. Uhh, a Snapple and a Fruitopia fall out."
287,Live in Austin!,Travis, Eyyyyyyyy. I toss the Fruitopia to… Taako.
288,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh, hear that Merle?"
289,Live in Austin!,Taako, Hell yeah!
290,Live in Austin!,Merle," No, I’m fine, don’t worry about my ass."
291,Live in Austin!,Griffin, But you have your fuckin gallon of Gatorade over there.
292,Live in Austin!,Clint, This is real!
293,Live in Austin!,Griffin, This is all real to—
294,Live in Austin!,Justin," Someone listening to this episode later just said— ‘Ohhh, he has a big jug of Gatorade. Okay. The thing from earlier makes total sense now!’"
295,Live in Austin!,Travis," Griffin, I slam the Snapple in one."
296,Live in Austin!,[pause],
297,Live in Austin!,Griffin, …Okay.
298,Live in Austin!,Travis," And then I read the cap. What’s the cap say, Griffin?"
299,Live in Austin!,Griffin, The cap of the Snapple?
300,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah.
301,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Says uh, this was poi— this was poisoned."
302,Live in Austin!,Clint," Did you know that if you turn the tab around on a can of soda, it’s a straw holder?"
303,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Whoooa, it says that on the Snapple? "
304,Live in Austin!,Travis, They’re advertising for soda.
305,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [crosstalk] For canned beverages now.
306,Live in Austin!,Travis, What a cross promotion.
307,Live in Austin!,Justin," Their slogan for years has been, “You’re wasting your time with Snapple!”"
308,Live in Austin!,Travis," “What’re you doing, there’s soda out there!”"
309,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Brody points down a hallway and says
310,Live in Austin!,Brody," Your guys’ classes, or should I say your ppprrriiison cellllllllllllls."
311,Live in Austin!,Taako," All right, Brody."
312,Live in Austin!,Brody," Should be down here. Try not to let— Try not to let ‘em keep ya down, all right?"
313,Live in Austin!,Magnus," It’s not Gattaca, Brody, come on!"
314,Live in Austin!,Brody," Later, skaterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrs."
315,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And then he pivots on his board and he skates down the stairwell and just grinds out of sight.
316,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Taako, I’ve turned on Brody."
317,Live in Austin!,Merle, Can we kill him later?
318,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Yes, we can!"

374,Live in Austin!,Justin, [laughing] Cuz dumb-dumb here decided to start a fight.
375,Live in Austin!,Travis," Now, I know how this works. First day you’ve gotta punch the biggest person you see."

395,Live in Austin!,[cross talk],
396,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, I know. Okay, Little Jerry is down on the ground now with Marvey and uh, you see them kinda scramble to their feet, and get ready to launch a counterattack but you hear footsteps coming down the hallway. Uh, and you hear someone clear their throat and when you look to the source of the interjection you see a dark-haired man wearing black and gray robes and he has a large silver medallion around his neck. Uh, and he walks towards you and the Hammerhead gang sorta rights themselves and they fix their hair and they say in unison"
397,Live in Austin!,Hammerheads," Good morning, Principal Hawthorne!"
398,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh and he says
399,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, [slowly] You boys weren’t fighting were you?
400,Live in Austin!,Magnus," No, sir! [crosstalk]"
401,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, [crosstalk] You do know– You know the consequences of fighting at Neverwinter High.
402,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Death.
403,Live in Austin!,Merle," Hit him, hit him, Magnus!"
404,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Nope!
405,Live in Austin!,Merle," Hit, Mr Hawthorne!"
406,Live in Austin!,Magnus, I respect authority. I am lawful good.
407,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
408,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He kind of— [crosstalk]
409,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] My ass.
410,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He kind of surveys the scene and sees which side of this, uh, fight has more bloody noses, and he points to the Hammerheads and he says,"
411,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, You three get to class. 
412,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And they scamper off and he looks at you three and he says,"
413,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne," You three, tell me—"
414,Live in Austin!,Justin, [laughing] Oh oh! Did they get to the infirmary? ‘Cause they got hit for twenty points of damage.
415,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
416,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.

418,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, I think they probably do, they run off to the nurse’s office to get seen to. Um, Principal Hawthorne says,"
419,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, You three.
420,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Yes, sir."
421,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, Were you bullying those sweet boys?
422,Live in Austin!,Magnus," No, sir, uh we came up on them fighting each other and we tried to break them up—"
423,Live in Austin!,Taako," No, Mag— Magnus sucker punched them, sir. For sure."
424,Live in Austin!,"[Audience clapping, cheering]",
425,Live in Austin!,Merle, We saw the whole thing! [crosstalk]
426,Live in Austin!,Taako," [crosstalk] Wait, wait, wait—"
427,Live in Austin!,Magnus," [crosstalk] What we meant to say was, we caught them smoking cigarettes and I said, no! Not today! Not here, not in my school, sir!"
428,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
429,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne," I do smell cigarettes. Magnus, let me smell your fingers. [threateningly]"
430,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Well! Okay! 
431,Live in Austin!,Merle, ’Scuse me?!
432,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Also gross but also, okay."
433,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He sniffs and he says,"
434,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, These are nicotine free. You’re good to go.
435,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
436,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Hi five, sir!"
437,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
438,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, You three get to class.
439,Live in Austin!,Travis, Oookay?
440,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, You’re late enough as is. 
441,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he turns, and with a swoop of his robe he turns and walks away."
442,Live in Austin!,Clint, Were we supposed to have known who that was?
443,Live in Austin!,Travis, Was it Nathaniel Hawthorne?
444,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, it was Nathaniel Hawthorne."
445,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
446,Live in Austin!,Justin," Damn, now I wish I had punched him! [Griffin and audience laugh] I hate that idiot!"
447,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So! The three of you make your way down the hallway and each approach a different classroom, that for some reason you just know is your first period class. And for this next part, I didn’t prep anything, I just let each of you decide what your first period class was gonna be? And… it will affect sort of a later thing? But, uh, let’s just feel out the space a little bit. Uhm, uh we’ll start with… we’ll start with, uhhh… Magnus. What class do you have for—"
448,Live in Austin!,Travis, Music Appreciation.
449,Live in Austin!,[Audience whoops and cheers],
450,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You walk into Music Appreciation class. Ummmmm… uhhhhhh…

454,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheering],
455,Live in Austin!,Justin," [dramatically] Arrive with spell cards, leave with immortality."
456,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
457,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, and it’s– it’s finals day here in music appreciation class. Surveying the room… surveying the room, you don't really recognize anybody here? Uh except for, in like the far back corner, is a high school aged Carey and Killian!"
458,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeaaaaaah!
459,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheering and applauding],
460,Live in Austin!,Travis, I— I post up with those fools. 
461,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah. You’re doing what?
462,Live in Austin!,Travis, I post up with them?
463,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
464,Live in Austin!,Travis, I go sit where they are?
465,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhhh yeah I think the three of you just spend time passing, passing notes? During the class?"
466,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Uhhh real quick before we, uh, it’s real cute, um before we get started, uhhhh… [voice goes higher] do you guys notice anything weird?"
467,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhhh, Carey says, uh…"
468,Live in Austin!,Carey, No? Nothing weird?
469,Live in Austin!,Griffin," This sounds like Brody, is the problem, I did Carey’s voice for Brody. She says—"
470,Live in Austin!,Carey," No, what’s going on Magnus?"
471,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Well, um, like yesterday? We were all like, of legal drinking age."
472,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
473,Live in Austin!,Magnus," At least. I’m not going to assume, I— I’ve never asked? You? But I thought, older than high school?"
474,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh… Killian says,"
475,Live in Austin!,Killian," I don’t know how to even respond to that, are you—"
476,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Fair enough.
477,Live in Austin!,Killian," Hey, are you on party drugs right now?"
478,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
479,Live in Austin!,Travis, Do I need to roll to check that?
480,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh no, you’re not on party drugs."
481,Live in Austin!,Travis," Okay! We’ll just [crosstalk] let the DM make decisions for my character, I guess!"
482,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Mr. Joe— Mr. Joe at the front of the class is like,"
483,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, You three! Keep it down! Magnus?
484,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Yep?
485,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, It’s your turn for your oral presentation. 
486,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
487,Live in Austin!,Justin, Ahaha! Nice.
488,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, Magnus?
489,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Yes?
490,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, For your final I have your song written down here that you have written a report about. [faint audience laughter] 
491,Live in Austin!,Clint, Oooohhhhh gaaaaaaawd [continued laughing]
492,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, It says here…
493,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Yes?
494,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe," I’ve never heard this before, and I teach music. Professionally. The name of the band is inappropriate. [Pause] Because it says ‘Barenaked Ladies.’ "
495,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheering and applauding],
496,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Yes, sir?"
497,Live in Austin!,Mr. Joe, The song is ‘One Week’ by ‘BareNaked Ladies.’
498,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers even louder],
499,Live in Austin!,Travis, Ahem-hem-hem.
500,Live in Austin!,Justin," Wait, you gotta button?"
501,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, I don’t have that on the board. I didn’t know he was gonna fucking— No."
502,Live in Austin!,Travis, And where— where would you— [crosstalk]
503,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Hang on wait. Can everyone just sing a few bars of ‘BareNaked Ladies’ ‘One Week’?
504,Live in Austin!,{26,28}
505,Live in Austin!,Travis, [singing] It’s been one week since you looked at me…
506,Live in Austin!,"[audience continuing the song from where Travis left off, quickly comes to a stop]",
507,Live in Austin!,Travis, [indistinguishable singing]
508,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Nobody knows the words. [slight pause] Oh, they do know the— all of the words."
509,Live in Austin!,Justin, Let’s pick it up from [crosstalk] ‘Chickity China’...
510,Live in Austin!,Travis," Wait, we’ll start at the good part. [starts singing] Chickity China the Chinese Chicken You have a drumstick and your..."
511,Live in Austin!,Travis & Justin," ...brain stops tickin,’ watchin’ X-Files with no lights on, we’re dans la maison I hope the Smoking Man’s in this one; like Harrison Ford I’m getting frantic, like Sting I’m tantric..."
512,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [singing continues in the background] Now we can’t release this.
513,Live in Austin!,Travis & Justin," Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy..."
514,Live in Austin!,Griffin, It’s not fair use. This is not a parody. This is just the song.
515,Live in Austin!,Travis & Justin," Like Kurosawa I make mad films, ‘kay, I don’t make films, or if I did they’d have a samurai. [indistinguishable sounds to fill in lyrics they don’t remember] always flying off the backswing. Get in tune with Sailor Moon ‘cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes that make me think the wrong thing. How can I help it, if I think it's funny when you’re mad? Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad. I’m the kind of guy that laughs at a funeral; can’t understand what I mean? Well you soon will..."
516,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Holy shit, guys??"
517,Live in Austin!,Travis & Justin," I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve, I have an history of taking off my shirt..."
518,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Alright—
519,Live in Austin!,Travis, It’s been one week since you looked at me… [stops singing]
520,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
521,Live in Austin!,Justin, That was good.
522,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.
523,Live in Austin!,Clint," The theme from F•R•I•E•N•D•S, ladies and gentlemen."
524,Live in Austin!,[Griffin laughing],
525,Live in Austin!,Clint, Right? Was that right?
526,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Hold on. Hold on. One second.
527,Live in Austin!,Clint, ‘Kay.
528,Live in Austin!,[‘Yeah Baby’ Clint voice clip plays],
529,Live in Austin!,[Clint laughter and audience laughter/cheering],
530,Live in Austin!,Travis, And just like that— [crosstalk]
531,Live in Austin!,Griffin, This is a good present— [crosstalk]
532,Live in Austin!,Travis, The birthday present was totally—
533,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Thank you, Travis, for this good present. Alright, so… appreciate for "
534,Live in Austin!,[stumbles] Dr. Joe now. He just graduated.,
535,Live in Austin!,[Travis laughing],
536,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Sitting at his desk—
537,Live in Austin!,Travis, My— my rendition of ‘One Week’ was that good?
538,Live in Austin!,Dr. Joe, Appreciate for me. Appreciate it. Appreciate.
539,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
540,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Well, sir, here’s the thing. The song at first seems like a superficial recount of things that one might do during one week, but if you look at it on a deeper level, what it really establishes is the the time it takes to fully appreciate your partner. Because you might look at it and say ‘you know what in that moment, I acted badly, but now one week later, it's given me time to think about what you mean to me, what I come across in this relationship. Only now, one week later do I fully appreciate that I didn’t appreciate you.’ And that's the juxtaposition that you get, sir."
541,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
542,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He—
543,Live in Austin!,Justin, I’m— I’m gonna have to—
544,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He stares at you for a second. And he just bursts into tears.
545,Live in Austin!,Justin," Also, I’m just gonna assume that's what Magnus sounded like in high school."
546,Live in Austin!,Travis," Yeaahh… Well, my voice broke at the beginning. [chuckles]"
547,Live in Austin!,Justin, Okay. 
548,Live in Austin!,Clint, Are you on him about character voices now?
549,Live in Austin!,Travis," Well, I didn’t alter my voice the 2% that turns it into Magnus."
550,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Joe— Joe, where are you, Joe? [pause] A through F, what would you give that class presentation? "
551,Live in Austin!,[Joe responds from audience],
552,Live in Austin!,Griffin, B plus. Alright.
553,Live in Austin!,Travis, Nice! [crosstalk]
554,Live in Austin!,Travis, I take it! 
555,Live in Austin!,Justin, Nice. Nice.
556,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
557,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Magnus, take one point of inspiration that you can spend later this episode."
558,Live in Austin!,Travis, [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
559,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uhhhhh… Merle. 
560,Live in Austin!,Clint, Hmm?
561,Live in Austin!,Griffin, What class do you have?
562,Live in Austin!,Clint, Um… Botany!
563,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
564,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Ummmmm… 
565,Live in Austin!,Clint, And I want Barry White music for mine.
566,Live in Austin!,Griffin," What’s your name on the left side of this row, in the front. Yes, you."
567,Live in Austin!,[response from female audience member],
568,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Ariel? Okay. Um, uh, Ms. Ariel is the teacher of this class. And, you scan the room and you kinda look around to see if you see any familiar faces and the only one that you see, in the front of the class, is Lucretia. Um—"
569,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
570,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And, uhhhh, she has a potted plant in front of her, everybody has these potted plants, and you’re— you’re kinda late. Uh, and you recognize your potted plant kinda sitting next to Lucretia. She’s working on a nice orchid, and these are your final presentations. And, uh, Ms. Ariel walks up to you as you come up to your seat and she says"
571,Live in Austin!,Ms. Ariel," You’re late, Merle."
572,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [to Ariel in the audience] That’s not what you sound like, I apologize."
573,Live in Austin!,Ms. Ariel," You’re late, Merle. You know you have to turn in your flower by the end of the day."
574,Live in Austin!,Merle," Yes, yes, I know."
575,Live in Austin!,Griffin," What are you growing, in this class?"
576,Live in Austin!,Merle, I am growing a shrubbery.
577,Live in Austin!,Justin, Let’s try it again. Try it again.
578,Live in Austin!,Merle, I am growing—
579,Live in Austin!,Clint," Wait, I gotta do a high school version—"
580,Live in Austin!,Travis, A high school old man.
581,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, motherfucker. Anything’ll do."
582,Live in Austin!,Clint, [away from mic] Okay.
583,Live in Austin!,Justin," Cut me off a piece of whatever, as long as it doesn’t sound like my father."
584,Live in Austin!,Travis," [crosstalk] Come on, funniest man in Huntington, stick the landing."
585,Live in Austin!,Clint," Alright, Alright."
586,Live in Austin!,Merle," [high-pitched old man voice] Uh, yeah. "
587,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
588,Live in Austin!,Travis, That was it. That was it.
589,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. 
590,Live in Austin!,Merle," I, uh, I been workin’ on a shrubbery. And it’s really cool."
591,Live in Austin!,Ms. Ariel," Actually, it looks sick and bad and it doesn't look good. It looks sick and bad."
592,Live in Austin!,Merle," No, no. Its one of those Japanese shrubberies that you trim to look sick and bad. It’s really healthy, because I dump fertilizer on it every day. "
593,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, you can talk some game, but your shrubbery looks bad, and it’s gonna look bad when you turn it in unless you do some magic or whatever to it to make it look better to turn in. "
594,Live in Austin!,Travis," Don’t say ‘or whatever,’ 'cause it's gonna be ‘or whatever.’"
595,Live in Austin!,Merle," Well, I’m a big believer in talking to my plants."
596,Live in Austin!,Justin," Fuck you, I quit."
597,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
598,Live in Austin!,Justin, I’m out. Is Taako in the building? Taako has left the building. Taako’s smoking with the cool kids.
599,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Lucretia looks over at your shrubbery and she says
600,Live in Austin!,Lucretia," I don't know, Merle. It looks pretty bad off. I’m worried about the grade you’re gonna get on this one."
601,Live in Austin!,Merle, Trust me.
602,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
603,Live in Austin!,Merle, I can do this.
604,Live in Austin!,Clint," Oh, god, now?"
605,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah.
606,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yes.
607,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter as Clint transforms his Gatorade bottle into a plant],
608,Live in Austin!,Clint, Wait a minute...
609,Live in Austin!,Justin (muffled), I’m here. [crosstalk]
610,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Is that supposed to look— be a plant now? ‘Cause, uh, okay."
611,Live in Austin!,Travis," Yeah, dad has turned, uh, for those of you at home—"
612,Live in Austin!,Justin," [crosstalk] Your human sons are in the room, your actual human sons."
613,Live in Austin!,Travis," Yes, please, my dad has turned his Gatorade bottle into a plant."
614,Live in Austin!,Justin," You're still Clint McElroy. When you walk on the stage please, please be cognizant of that. "
615,Live in Austin!,Travis, And don’t fuck this plant.
616,Live in Austin!,Clint, This would be—
617,Live in Austin!,Merle, [softly] Hi. 
618,Live in Austin!,Justin (muffled), No.
619,Live in Austin!,[Griffin chuckles],
620,Live in Austin!,Justin (muffled), No. Stop. 
621,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He’s— sorry, sorry, for the audience at home, [uncomfortably close to the mic] he’s fondling the plant."
622,Live in Austin!,Merle," Y’know, uh, I’ve been nurturing you for a long time."
623,Live in Austin!,[Travis walks backstage],
624,Live in Austin!,Justin," Hey, my— hey Trav, get me one? Will you get me one too? [crosstalk] I needed another gi— whiskey and ginger ale if anybody could hook a Justin up for this. "
625,Live in Austin!,Merle, Nobody really understands our relationship. Y’know—
626,Live in Austin!,[Justin joins Travis off stage],
627,Live in Austin!,Clint, You know—
628,Live in Austin!,Justin?/Travis?, [distantly] The hell?
629,Live in Austin!,Griffin," I’m still here. [laughs] Hey, dad—"

631,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Hey dad, I’m lovin’ this. "
632,Live in Austin!,Merle," I, uh, y’know I believe in you. You have strong roots."
633,Live in Austin!,Griffin, It’s starting— it’s starting to grow a few leeeaves.
634,Live in Austin!,Merle," And someday, you’ll tower above all the other shrubs. And you’re going to [pause] blossom... into fullness."
635,Live in Austin!,Clint, Tell me when they get back so I can really be—

649,Live in Austin!,Justin, Bad people win when good people sit by and say nothing!
650,Live in Austin!,Griffin," The, uh, the plant grows and blooms and blossoms and is... fine..."
651,Live in Austin!,[Clint laughs],
652,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, Ariel, what was the grade on that one?"
653,Live in Austin!,[response from Ariel],
654,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That’s a D!
655,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
656,Live in Austin!,Justin, That’s short for ‘don’t.’
657,Live in Austin!,Griffin," D is actually, uh… "
658,Live in Austin!,Clint," Uh, no, no, no. I think she said B."
659,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [rising in pitch] No, I’m pretty sure it was a D for dog."
660,Live in Austin!,Clint, You people who seemed to like me more who are sitting near Ariel—
661,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Nope, nope. No judging— you, uh, you’re gonna take disadvantage later, at a moment of my choosing. [Audience boos] We gotta keep moving. Mer— or, ah, Taako. What is your class?"
662,Live in Austin!,Justin," Whoa, I just wanna say real quick, that is quite a strong drink you’ve prepared for me, so if things get weird later, blame Travis."

666,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, you hit me. What class do you have?"

672,Live in Austin!,Griffin, What's your name? [answer from audience] Rick?
673,Live in Austin!,Clint," Rick, you’re an enabler."
674,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Mr. Ricky is the teacher of home economics.
675,Live in Austin!,[Audience Cheering],
676,Live in Austin!,Travis," Mr. Rick does sound like the name of the cool teacher that's like, ‘nah please call me Mr. Rick.’"
677,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh Mr. Ricky— [crosstalk]
678,Live in Austin!,Justin, ‘Here's some booze I brought you—’
679,Live in Austin!,[all laugh],

716,Live in Austin!,Taako, There she is. What's up?
717,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Mr. Rick walks up to the front of the class and he says— and Rick, I apologize. "
718,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
719,Live in Austin!,Clint," Wait, can I give a little background music?"
720,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh, I actually— oh SHIT I had background music for all of these and I forgot them."
721,Live in Austin!,Clint," Aww, excellent."
722,Live in Austin!,Justin," Sorry, dad."
723,Live in Austin!,[pause],
724,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Wait, why is—"
725,Live in Austin!,[Persona 4 - Like A Dream Come True begins to play],
726,Live in Austin!,Clint, That's really good.
727,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh—
728,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
729,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You walk into the class and see Ren and sit next to her, and Mr. Rick walks up to the front of the class and says"
730,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick," Alright, y’all know the deal. We’re making ham sandwiches again."
731,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He says
732,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick," Nobody try anything funny, don't add anything weird or fancy to ‘em. I just want everybody to turn in their regular [Clint cracks up] ham sandwiches at the end of the class. Nobody better lead some kinda food revolution, [audience laughter] here in this class. I just want a plain-ass— plain-ass ham sandwich— don't tell on me I said ‘ass’ to you kids."
733,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
734,Live in Austin!,Clint," Mr. Rick has been teaching for a very long time, [crosstalk] hasn't he."
735,Live in Austin!,Griffin,  [crosstalk] He has— He says
736,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick," You got ffi— it’s just ten minutes. It's a ham sandwich, just do it. Uhhh, and again, nobody better do anything fancy or lead some sort of... Footloose-style... culinary uprising against me, all right."
737,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Taako, you and Ren are partners on this project. What do you make?"
738,Live in Austin!,Justin," Wait, I'm partners with— did you say Rick, or Ren?"
739,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Ren.
740,Live in Austin!,Justin," Uuuuummmmm, we’re making croque-monsieur."
741,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
742,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You're making croque-monsieur and the whole time Ren is like
743,Live in Austin!,Ren, Are you sure— this isn't what he asked for. This is—
744,Live in Austin!,Taako," Well, uh, why don't you pass the nutmeg and the gruyère "
745,Live in Austin!,and we can talk about it later.,
746,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Did you load up a recipe?
747,Live in Austin!,Justin, What?
748,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Did you load up a recipe—
749,Live in Austin!,Clint," Hell yes, he did."
750,Live in Austin!,Justin," Hell yeah, I did. [Clint laughs]"
751,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Tell me what you do with this.
752,Live in Austin!,Justin," I, uhm—"
753,Live in Austin!,Griffin (softly), Walk me through it.
754,Live in Austin!,Justin," Okay, well. We're gonna preheat the oven to 400 degrees."
755,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, not that granular. [audience cheers] Okay, you turn in—"
756,Live in Austin!,Justin," I mean I make it. What do you want, PERVERT? "
757,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
758,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You turn in your fancy ham sandwich.
759,Live in Austin!,Justin, It’s a croque-monsieur.
760,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And Mr. Rick says
761,Live in Austin!,Mr Rick, What do you think you're doin’? Take this back. I want a regular ham sandwich. That's what I asked for. You trying to get an F?
762,Live in Austin!,Taako," If F stands for fantastic croque-monsieur, then yes."
763,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
764,Live in Austin!,Taako," Hey, Rick—"
765,Live in Austin!,Griffin, A few of the—
766,Live in Austin!,Taako," Hey, Rick."
767,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick, Yeah?
768,Live in Austin!,Taako," [flirty] Take a bite, Rick."
769,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],

771,Live in Austin!,Taako, RIIICK—
772,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick, It's a weird looking ham sandwich—
773,Live in Austin!,Taako, RIIIICK. RIICK.
774,Live in Austin!,Griffin,  Some like other students in the class are standing up and just saying like 
775,Live in Austin!,Students," Take a BITE, RICK!"
776,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
777,Live in Austin!,Taako, Take a—
778,Live in Austin!,Clint," TAKE a BITE, RICK!"
779,Live in Austin!,Clint and Travis," TAKE A BITE, RICK!"
780,Live in Austin!,"All, chanting"," TAKE A BITE, RICK! TAKE A BITE, RICK!!"
781,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, thank you. He says,"
782,Live in Austin!,Mr. Rick, Fine. God I just— every class I get bullied by kids. Bullied by kids into doing things.
783,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He takes a bite of your fancy ham sandwich and he says…
784,Live in Austin!,[pause],
785,Live in Austin!,Clint, D.
786,Live in Austin!,Griffin," I think his, like, his, like, uh— he just runs out of the classroom, sort of crying, and his pants fall down while he's going. [audience laughter] And suddenly like all the students are just like up on their desks Matilda-style, cheering you and Ren on. [audience cheers] Uh, you— the— you don't get a grade traditionally from Rick because he ran away and his pants fell down but— again, sorry, real Rick— uh, but the rest of the students get together and give you an A for the class. [audience cheers] And A stands for auto— aut—"
787,Live in Austin!,Justin, [crosstalk] Advantage?
788,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Auto 20.
789,Live in Austin!,Justin," Awww, yeah."
790,Live in Austin!,Griffin, So at any point when you're about to roll you can just take a crit instead.
791,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
792,Live in Austin!,Justin, [laughing] You do— are you sure you want to give that to me?
793,Live in Austin!,Clint, Awww.
794,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.
795,Live in Austin!,Justin, All right.
796,Live in Austin!,Griffin," All right, let's get into it. The three of you have fourth period together. You make your way out of the classroom building and over to the campus’s massive gymnasium for P.E."
797,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
798,Live in Austin!,Griffin," This facility is massive. The main gymnasium room has side chambers for locker rooms and a coach's office and a concession stand with a long open service window. The west and east walls are lined with bleachers that are like folded in right now, they’re not deployed bleachers-style. And they’re stacked 15 feet high, leaving more room for sports to happen. [audience giggling] I wrote that. [audience laughter] Hanging from the ceiling are two basketball hoops on either end of the floor. And uhhh, uhhh uh... I wrote ‘and backboards’ like yeah, of course. [audience laughter] Below you the hardwood floor is slick and polished, you can barely see the seam in the middle of the floor where it opens up to reveal the Olympic sized pool underneath."
799,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
800,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, It’s a Wonderful Life like a motherfucker. "
801,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
802,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Sorry?
803,Live in Austin!,Justin, It's a Wonderful Life? [crosstalk] The dancing contest—
804,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oh yeah yea—
805,Live in Austin!,Justin, It opens up—
806,Live in Austin!,Clint," It's all right, [crosstalk] 15 people in the audience got it—"
807,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, no, I get it, just traditionally you don't hear the words ‘it's a wonderful life,' like—"
808,Live in Austin!,Griffin and Travis, '—a motherfucker.’
809,Live in Austin!,[audience laughter],
810,Live in Austin!,[Clint laughs],
811,Live in Austin!,[crosstalk],
812,Live in Austin!,Justin," Sydnee really likes that movie, so we watched it—"
813,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, it's a good one."
814,Live in Austin!,Justin, For the holiday—
815,Live in Austin!,Griffin, So there's some familiar face—
816,Live in Austin!,Justin," Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight."
817,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Jesus.
818,Live in Austin!,Clint, Jimmy Stewart.
819,Live in Austin!,Justin, Yeeaahh.
820,Live in Austin!,Clint, Donna Reed.
821,Live in Austin!,Justin, Donna Reed!
822,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Hell yeah, who else was in this film? "
823,Live in Austin!, [audience laughter],
824,Live in Austin!,Griffin," So, there are some familiar faces in this classroom and you see them after everybody changes into their athletic attire and lines up on half court. Angus is there, he's in the lineup, next to you. So are Carey and Killian. Down the line a bit is Brody who inexplicably is still on his skateboard. [audience laughter] At the far end, all goofing on each other and just endlessly combing their hair are the Hammerheads. Suddenly the coach's office door opens and slams shut and a serious-faced human man walks toward the lot of you. And Angus kinda like sees that you're having trouble remembering who this person is so he whispers his name discreetly to the three of you. He says,"
825,Live in Austin!,Angus," Oh, that’s Coach Derek Taylor."
826,Live in Austin!,[music plays] [audience cheers],
827,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And Coach Derek Taylor walks forward—
828,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] Coooooach Derek Taylor!!
829,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Sorry, I thought this Friday Night Lights reference would get more of a—"
830,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
831,Live in Austin!,{{44,23}}
832,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m more of a Saturday Night Lights kind of person.
833,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Coach Derek Taylor walks forward and gives you all a very inspiring speech.
834,Live in Austin!,Travis, Do it now.
835,Live in Austin!,Clint," Come on, do it! Give us the speech!"
836,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
837,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor," It’s come to my attention that there are some folks in this class that think P.E. is a big, dumb waste of time."
838,Live in Austin!,"[laughter, one person audibly booing]",
839,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," I’ll be the first to admit that P.E. isn’t as sexy as algebra or world history. But when you graduate you’ll look back on the lessons you learned in this class as some of the most valuable of your whole high school career. Lessons like accountability, leadership, how to catch a ball or throw a ball very fast at a teammate or some sort of goal. You don’t have to savor every moment of this class, but here in my gym you will show myself, and each other, some respect. Clear eyes, full sports, have fun!"
840,Live in Austin!,"[audience cheers, Travis laughing]",
841,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s good.
842,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor, Today we’re continuing our 3-on-3 basketball tournament. Looks like our first match-up is the Hammerheads verses Tres— I’m not gonna say that. 
843,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He looks at the three of you and he says,"
844,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Next time, you guys need to pick a different team name. I’m not gonna say that."
845,Live in Austin!,Justin," Uh, I cast Blur and Enhance Ability Cat’s Grace."
846,Live in Austin!,[‘hell yeah’ can be heard from audience],
847,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, what’s that do?"
848,Live in Austin!,Justin," Blur— my body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering, to all who can see me for the duration. Any creatures have disadvantage for any attack rolls made against me, translate that into basketball. And then I get Cat’s Grace."
849,Live in Austin!,Griffin, What’s that?
850,Live in Austin!,Justin," Y’know, it’s like, good at basketball. "
851,Live in Austin!,[Griffin and audience laughing],
852,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Fucking Gary Gygax hunched over his desk like, ‘we need a basketball spell.’`"
853,Live in Austin!,[audience laughing],
854,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Coach Derek Taylor says, like"
855,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Hey, you didn’t just cast a bunch of magic on yourself to make yourself better at basketball like the Monstars, did ya? Hey, Taako. Hey, Taako—"
856,Live in Austin!,Taako, [crosstalk] Yeah?
857,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor, You didn’t just cast a whole bunch of spells on yourself to make yourself better like the Monstars—
858,Live in Austin!,Justin," I look down on him ‘cause I cast Alter Self to be taller too. We’ve come this far without using magic, I figured I could burn a few slots. "
859,Live in Austin!,Griffin," All right, yeah. Uh, all right. The three of you take your basketball positions and Coach Derek Taylor holds out a basketball at center court. Marvey takes position for the jump, while he’s got still kind of a black eye situation from earlier. Who’s going to take the jump ball for Tres Horny Boys?"
860,Live in Austin!,Travis," Well, Taako’s very tall now, sooo…"
861,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] I’ll do it!
862,Live in Austin!,Travis, It’s Taako. 
863,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
864,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, Merle does it."
865,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Alright, Merle—"
866,Live in Austin!,Clint, I do it!
867,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Merle, roll an athletics check."
868,Live in Austin!,Travis, I stand behind Merle and throw him up in the air.
869,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, no, no—"
870,Live in Austin!,Travis, Globetrotters style!
871,Live in Austin!,{{47,13}}
872,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] We do— no, that’s not how the Globe—"
873,Live in Austin!,Travis, GLOBE! TROTTERS! STYLE!
874,Live in Austin!,Justin, You know how the Globetrotters have always thrown each other around?
875,Live in Austin!,Clint, I throw a bucket of confetti at everybody!
876,Live in Austin!,Travis, Rip Taylor style!
877,Live in Austin!,Justin," I have, uh advantage on dexterity checks, that’s Cat’s Grace."
878,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, okay. Uh, athletics—"
879,Live in Austin!,Travis," 8, so that’s an 8 total."
880,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, uh, Marvey jumps up and just, fucking posterizes you as he secures the ball for his team—"
881,Live in Austin!,Travis, I karate chop his legs as he comes down.
882,Live in Austin!,Justin, That’s definitely a technical foul.
883,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah you can do that but is — hey guys?! It’s basketball, a little bit, kind of, sometimes?"
884,Live in Austin!,Clint, I will explain—
885,Live in Austin!,Travis," Okay I won’t karate chop his legs, but I will like—"
886,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Cover him?
887,Live in Austin!,Travis, Check him? Yes.
888,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
889,Live in Austin!,Travis, Wait is this hockey?
890,Live in Austin!,Griffin, No!
891,Live in Austin!,Clint, The irony of us playing a basketball game-game should not be lost on you.
892,Live in Austin!,Griffin," We used to have a basketball hoop in our backyard, we know—"
893,Live in Austin!,Justin, And we were all right at it—
894,Live in Austin!,Travis, And we were bad at it!
895,Live in Austin!,Clint," Then take the net down, make it about 8 feet high."
896,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That is true.
897,Live in Austin!,Justin," My dad used to organise this thing on Wednesdays and Saturdays after we did all our chores, called Whoops Fest, it was w-h-o-o-p-s, and it was a combination uh, of basketball and Doctor Who day. Where we would—"
898,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
899,Live in Austin!,Justin," Think about it, it makes sense where if we did all our chores we got to watch Doctor Who and play basketball."
900,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Um.
901,Live in Austin!,Travis, And that’s how we’re the well balanced children we are today.
902,Live in Austin!,Justin, Yeah.
903,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah. Uh, Magnus. Sounds like you’re covering Marvey. He’s trying to pass it— he’s trying to pass it to Jerreeeeee, make a… make an athletics check."
904,Live in Austin!,[sound of dice rolling],
905,Live in Austin!,Travis, Nope.
906,Live in Austin!,Clint, Whoa!
907,Live in Austin!,Travis, What’s inspiration do?
908,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, gives you advantage so you can roll again."
909,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m gonna take that here 'cause that was a one. [crosstalk]
910,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] That was a one!
911,Live in Austin!,[sound of dice rolling],
912,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh yeah, that was an 18—"
913,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay you get it.
914,Live in Austin!,Travis," —plus… 8, 26."
915,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You steal— you steal the ball from Marvey and now you have what’s called possession of the basketball.
916,Live in Austin!,Travis," Um, I would like to juke around said Marvey."
917,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, uh, this was a maneuver. You will also roll plus athletics for this."
918,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s a 20.
919,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
920,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah. Alright, you get around him and you break away so you are not covered at all if you want to go for a shot."
921,Live in Austin!,Travis, I wanna go for two!
922,Live in Austin!,Clint," [sarcastic] Oh, what a surprise!"
923,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Make a dexterity roll as you shoot the ball at the hoop.
924,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s a 17 plus 2.
925,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That’s 2 points for Tres Horny Boys! Swish!
926,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering and clapping],
927,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Little Jerry takes the ball and is gonna try to pass it to Marvey. Merle or Taako, you wanna get in on this or are you trying to look for a spell to cast at this basketball game?"
928,Live in Austin!,Clint, I cast—
929,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Holy shit.
930,Live in Austin!,Clint, —Lycanthropy and turn myself into a Teen Wolf!
931,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah!
932,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
933,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah!
934,Live in Austin!,Travis, Now—
935,Live in Austin!,Clint," Shut up Travis, shut up Travis!"
936,Live in Austin!,Travis," B-b-before we celebrate too much Dad, I have to ask; [high pitched] do you have Lycanthropy?"
937,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That’s not even a fucking spell—
938,Live in Austin!,Clint," [mocking] I don’t know because I don’t have any spell cards! [Someone Joe.] Tell him, Lycanthropy’s a real spell!"
939,Live in Austin!,Griffin, It’s super fucking not!
940,Live in Austin!,[more cheering],
941,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You can cast, like, Disguise Self to look like a werewolf."
942,Live in Austin!,Justin," 'Cause here’s what happens. I’m gonna settle this, uh, he cast Disguise Self to look like a werewolf but he continues to play with the ability of Merle so h— [wheeze laughter] he’s— he’s like a werewolf that plays basketball as good as dad."
943,Live in Austin!,Griffin," That’s good, you’ve disguised yourself to look like a werewolf—"
944,Live in Austin!,Clint, I will accept that compromise!
945,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, we’re gonna make a, uh, a contest against each other with athletics you— to the number you just rolled. You roll your 20-sided dice, please Christ in Heaven don’t do this to me every time. I rolled a 2."
946,Live in Austin!,Travis," Huh, I rolled a 4—"
947,Live in Austin!,Clint, I rolled a 4!
948,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay you steal the ball from—
949,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah!
950,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
951,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, you’re right up against it but now you are covered, uh, by Jerreeeeee. So you can take a shot but you’re gonna have disadvantage or you can give it to one of your teammates."
952,Live in Austin!,Clint," I’m gonna [garbled words] it looks to me like Taako is open, and—"
953,Live in Austin!,Travis, Is that accurate?
954,Live in Austin!,Griffin," By the way, by the way, by the way, before this play starts, you hear the same bell and it chimes 3 times."
955,Live in Austin!,Clint, What? What bell?
956,Live in Austin!,Griffin," From the beginning. I forgot to do the rest of the bells, we’re at 3 bells."
957,Live in Austin!,[audience laughing],
958,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oops~! [giggles]
959,Live in Austin!,Clint," 3 bells? What are you, Popeye the Sailor?"
960,Live in Austin!,Justin, Has that been going down every time?
961,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [seriously] Yes. That’s the— that’s the weird thing is if I had been doing ‘em, they’d have been going down this whole time."
962,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
963,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Can you imagine if, like, the whole time the bells have been going down in number—"
964,Live in Austin!,Travis, Oh man.
965,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And you’d be like, ‘Woah! What?!’"
966,Live in Austin!,Clint," Dong! Oh yeah, that would have built some serious tension."
967,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Right. But imagine, and now it’s at 3, oh no!"
968,Live in Austin!,Travis, [laughing]
969,Live in Austin!,Justin," That’s so much worse than 4, which would have happened a few minutes ago!"
970,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Merle, what are you doing? We’ve been going an hour."
971,Live in Austin!,Clint," Well I, uh, uh, the 3 bells threw me off! Um, I notice that because Taako is so beloved and well regarded that he’s not—"
972,Live in Austin!,Travis, He’s yelling.
973,Live in Austin!,Clint," Well I have to, to be heard over you guys. "
974,Live in Austin!,Travis, Fair enough.
975,Live in Austin!,Clint," He, uh, he— I pass it to Taako because he’s free and clear and driving toward— as the only one of the four of us who's ever actually seen a basketball game, I pass it to Taako because he’s driving on the— on the basket."
976,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Alright, make a—"
977,Live in Austin!,Justin, And I throw it into the hole.
978,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Hold on! Roll your pass, roll plus dex."
979,Live in Austin!,Clint, Roll plus dex.
980,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Dexterity.
981,Live in Austin!,Travis, Roll the— roll—
982,Live in Austin!,Griffin," It’s a 0, I’ll make it easy for you, it’s a 0."
983,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah but that’s a 19!
984,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Alright, you get it to Taako."
985,Live in Austin!,Justin, I cast Levitate and I dunk it!
986,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
987,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Alright. 
988,Live in Austin!,Clint," Surely you’ve got music for this, Griffin! You have to have music, something from Space Jam! "
989,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, you have dunk music?"
990,Live in Austin!,[Space Jam Theme Song plays],
991,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
992,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh, wait, roll athletics Taako!"
993,Live in Austin!,Travis, Crit 20!
994,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] It really did, it was a crit 20."
995,Live in Austin!,Clint," [crosstalk] Oh, here he goes!"
996,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He’s gonna fucking sprint off the stage.
997,Live in Austin!,Travis, Crit 20...
998,Live in Austin!,Justin," I— y’know what, that was a crit 20! I’m gonna need it again, Griffin!"
999,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh, you wanna hear the—?"
1000,Live in Austin!,Clint," Yeah, yeah."
1001,Live in Austin!,[Space Jam Theme Song resumes],
1002,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah!
1003,Live in Austin!,Griffin," It does double damage, it does double Space Jam. Okay, um, yeah all right, that’s, that’s another good 2 points up on the board. Uh, the bell chimes 2 times. "
1004,Live in Austin!,Justin, [through laughter] I don’t care!
1005,Live in Austin!,Clint," What, what is this bell?"
1006,Live in Austin!,Griffin," When the bell chimes 2 times you see Principal Hawthorne come in the room and start talking with Coach Derek Taylor about something. Um, and Little Jerry’s got the ball and he’s gonna pass it to Marvey, and Marvey is running down the, the basketball lane, getting ready to score points [crosstalk] for their team."
1007,Live in Austin!,Travis, [crosstalk] I block him.
1008,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, uh, roll athletics. "
1009,Live in Austin!,Travis, Nope!
1010,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Alright, he gets right by ya."
1011,Live in Austin!,Clint," Another 1, we wanna keep track of all these."
1012,Live in Austin!,Travis," That’s a crit 1, thanks new dice. "
1013,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Marvey throws up a 3, gets a 21, that’s 3 points. 3 to 4—"
1014,Live in Austin!,Travis, Oh I was so confused 'cause I thought you threw up a 3 and got 21 points.
1015,Live in Austin!,[audience laughing],
1016,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Who’s, uh, who's gonna take the ball in for your team?"
1017,Live in Austin!,Justin, I’m gonna cast Clairvoyance over where the two of them are talking.
1018,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
1019,Live in Austin!,Justin," Uh, so I have a spell, like, I can hear the shit they’re saying."
1020,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. And fuckin’ Principal—
1021,Live in Austin!,Travis, I got the ball.
1022,Live in Austin!,Griffin," —Hawthorne’s like,"
1023,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, Did you see Scandal last night?
1024,Live in Austin!,Travis, I grab the ball.
1025,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And Coach Derek Taylor’s like,"
1026,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor," Aw nah, my DVR fucked up again."
1027,Live in Austin!,[audience laughing],
1028,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor," Clear eyes, full sports, have fun."
1029,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, okay!"
1030,Live in Austin!,Travis, I pa— I have the ball.
1031,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yes?
1032,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’d like to pass it to Merle.
1033,Live in Austin!,Griffin," All right, you’re actually being, at this point, you’re being covered by Marvey and he’s like, "
1034,Live in Austin!,Marvey," Oh gonna pass? Aw, such a tough guy."
1035,Live in Austin!,Travis, I hit him with my butt real hard and knock him out of the way.
1036,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, roll, uh, roll a butt attack."
1037,Live in Austin!,Travis," Uh, is that strength?"
1038,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah~.
1039,Live in Austin!,Travis, So that’s a 15.
1040,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, okay yeah, you butt attack him out of the way."
1041,Live in Austin!,Travis, I pass to Merle.
1042,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. You roll a- I think dex for a pass to Merle.
1043,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh no, god these suck! [singsong?] Uhhh ummm, that’s not it. Hit my can...that’s a 6 total."
1044,Live in Austin!,[Griffin laughs],
1045,Live in Austin!,Griffin," With a 6 you, like, overarm throw it to Merle and it just goes up and it gets stuck in the rafters."
1046,Live in Austin!,[audience laughing],
1047,Live in Austin!,Griffin," The play stops for a little bit while they try to find a new ball and Merle calls the three of you over— er, Merle, Jesus. Uh, Angus calls the three of you over, he’s standing over by the bleachers and he’s like,"
1048,Live in Austin!,Angus," Hey! Come here, come here, come here."
1049,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he’s got one, he’s got one of those big books you saw him with, and he says um,"
1050,Live in Austin!,Angus," I— I think I figured out what’s going on. What this is is not just a dream you all are having, it’s a— it’s a Dreamscape! That’s, uh, it’s like kind of a type of magic and somebody usually makes it. And I guess what is bad is, like, usually when you’re in a Dreamscape, somebody brings you there to, like, usually just to like test you or something and see how you respond in like a, some sort of crisis scenario. "
1051,Live in Austin!,Clint, Well as long as Ariel’s not grading we oughta be alright [crosstalk] I love you. I love you very much-
1052,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] Geez, still gonna hold that against her? Uh, and as he says that, the bell chimes one and all hell breaks loose. Pretty much literally. For a moment you think that the mechanisms in the floor below you have activated, opening up the pool below but what really happens is just a shock tears through the room and you see this purple pulsating rift torn open in the centre of the gym floor sending these bright fissures out in all directions. And from those fissures, these gnarled hands start to punch up and claw their way upward. "
1053,Live in Austin!,Griffin," The next few seconds are full of just, like, panicked running and screaming from all the students in the room, as a horde of shambling zombies rise up from the floor and begin pursuing the zom— begin pursuing the students around the gym. And you hear shouts coming from all around, you hear students— you hear one student yell,"
1054,Live in Austin!,Student, The doors are locked! We’re trapped!
1055,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And sure enough, students are banging at the one exit, back out onto the quad but you can see it’s sealed by some sort of magic force. And so some of the students are just, like, scrambling up the wall of bleachers to get to safety. You see some rushing into one of the locker rooms and Coach Derek Taylor’s there just ushering them all into safety. This scene is chaos but you see Carey and Killian making their way into that locker room where most of the students are going to and motioning to the three of you wildly to follow them—"
1056,Live in Austin!,Travis," I motion back, no—"
1057,Live in Austin!,Killian," No, you come in here to the locker room!"
1058,Live in Austin!,Magnus," No listen, this is gonna be great! We haven’t fought zombies yet, I’m very excited!"
1059,Live in Austin!,Griffin," They say, "
1060,Live in Austin!,Killian," Please come to the locker room, you don’t have any stuff!"
1061,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Sure enough, you don’t have any weapons or gear to speak of."
1062,Live in Austin!,Justin," I have been in the locker room for 3 minutes, just—"
1063,Live in Austin!,[Clint laughing],
1064,Live in Austin!,Griffin," The three of you are in the locker room, I’m gonna go fuckin’ turbo mode because we’ve been going for 67 minutes. And a wave of undead pursue you close behind but Coach Derek slams the door as soon as the three of you clear it and barricades it with a few containers nearby. Most of the student—"
1065,Live in Austin!,Travis, Describe the containers.
1066,Live in Austin!,[Griffin clicks his tongue],
1067,Live in Austin!,Griffin," They’re metal. Most of the students made it in here and they’re all just kinda nervously milling about and there’s a narrow window in the door and through it you see the zombies just, like, pushing against the door all moaning in unison. And across the way on top of that—"
1068,Live in Austin!,Travis," Wait hold on, [to audience] moan in unison."
1069,Live in Austin!,[audience moans in unison],
1070,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Very spooky.
1071,Live in Austin!,Travis, Thank you.
1072,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And across the way on top of the stacked up bleachers you see a few unfortunate souls who didn’t make it to the relative safety of the locker room. The Hammerheads all ended up there, as did Principal Hawthorne. Brody is up there, still—"
1073,Live in Austin!,Travis, Noooo!
1074,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He’s still on his skateboard. You recognise one more student up there too, standing on the bleachers nervously clutching his book is Angus McDonald."
1075,Live in Austin!,[audience screaming],
1076,Live in Austin!,Griffin," They seem to be safe for now, they’re 15 ft up a sheer wall of bleachers, but the undead are clambering at the bleachers trying to pile up high enough to reach them."
1077,Live in Austin!,Clint," Aww, that’s too bad. That’s really too bad."
1078,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Coach Taylor says— you hear Coach Taylor say,"
1079,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Aw shit, shit shit! I’m gonna lose my job, I have to start over at a new school with a new team of kids whose lives I’m gonna have to transform all over again—"
1080,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Hey! You listen to me! That’s not how seniority works, good luck!"
1081,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, he turns to the class and he says,"
1082,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Okay, new assignment; anyone who wants to prove their physical fitness by getting out there and killing all those monsters gets an A in this class for the whole semester. Who’s game?"
1083,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1084,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And, uh, Killian walks up and says,"
1085,Live in Austin!,Killian," How about the whole year, not just the whole semester."
1086,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he says,"
1087,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Okay fine, fine, the whole year!"
1088,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Yeah! High five!
1089,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Anybody else, any takers?!"
1090,Live in Austin!,Magnus, Yeah.
1091,Live in Austin!,Merle," I gotta raise my— raise my D average, so yeah, I’ll do it."
1092,Live in Austin!,Taako, [dismissive] I’m good.
1093,Live in Austin!,[Clint laughs],
1094,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He looks over to [garbled words] and he’s like,"
1095,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Taako, you’ve got a J in P— this class. Are you sure? This could really save your—"
1096,Live in Austin!,Taako, All right I’ll save your ass.
1097,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says,"
1098,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," I can’t send you out there unequipped, come with me."
1099,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he takes you into a large room labeled ‘Sports Supplies’, and surrounding you are balls and bats and gloves and mats and pads and masks and sticks of every sport you can imagine. And Coach Taylor walks you to the middle of this room and says,"
1100,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Okay, I’m gonna sanctify this room full of, just, beautiful sports equipment, so y’all can take your pick. It’s not a perfect solution but it’s better than nothing. "
1101,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And he kneels down in the centre of the room and he channels his holy symbol; his high school football state champions ring.
1102,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1103,Live in Austin!,Clint, And you know what? That is such an inspiration to Merle—
1104,Live in Austin!,Travis, We get it.
1105,Live in Austin!,Clint, That he decides that he’s gonna dedicate himself—
1106,Live in Austin!,[Griffin laughs],
1107,Live in Austin!,Clint, —to sports!
1108,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says a prayer to sanctify this room of sports equipment and he says,"
1109,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," In this, our hour of need, we ask for your athletic patronage and protection. Oh, light of my life, end-zone of the cosmos."
1110,Live in Austin!,Clint,  You have been working on this for months.
1111,Live in Austin!,Griffin," He says, "
1112,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," This is my lord, my saviour, Touchdown Todd."
1113,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1114,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Todd! We need ya real bad right now, buddy. Bless these here beautiful sporting goods with your undeniable power so that these children might go and kill a bunch of monsters with them. In your holy name I pray boom shaka laka."
1115,Live in Austin!,Clint, Boom shaka laka laka! Boom shaka laka laka!
1116,Live in Austin!,Griffin, What sports gear do you outfit yourselves with?
1117,Live in Austin!,Travis, Here’s what I’m gonna need.
1118,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [audibly smiling] Yeah?
1119,Live in Austin!,Travis, I need a football helmet.
1120,Live in Austin!,Griffin, ‘Kay.
1121,Live in Austin!,Travis, I need two bats.
1122,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yep.
1123,Live in Austin!,Travis," Uh, I’m gonna need some shoulder pads. "
1124,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Qu— are you going qu— uh, to make this faster; quarterback pads or like, linebacker pads? "
1125,Live in Austin!,Travis," Quarterback pads, I gotta move."
1126,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, okay. Take plus 1 AC for your— your pads—"
1127,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah!
1128,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And, uh, really— what’s really convenient is that all the bats have the same stats as the weapons you already have."
1129,Live in Austin!,Travis, Oh nice!
1130,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Taako and Merle?
1131,Live in Austin!,Clint, I’m gonna wear a Lacrosse helmet and two fencing foils with the tips broken off.
1132,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. Everybody’s kinda double— double-fisting.
1133,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m ambidextrous!
1134,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah sure. Taako, what you lookin’ at? You still looking at that croque-monsieur recipe? "
1135,Live in Austin!,Justin," I’m getting pretty hungry over here! Uh, I take two Jai Alai cestas. They’re big fucking wooden scoops. They look sweet. For Jai Alai, y’know?"
1136,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah Jai Alai, I know about Jai Alai. So you’re casting spells with your Jai Alai gear?"
1137,Live in Austin!,Justin, Yeah.
1138,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. Uh—
1139,Live in Austin!,Justin," And then I put them down, I’m like ‘that’s hard to pronounce,’ and pick up a badminton racket. And, you guessed it, a shuttlecock!"
1140,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1141,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Cool, uh. Carey comes out strapped in with this track ‘n’—"
1142,Live in Austin!,Clint, A what? What did you just say?
1143,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [confused] I haven’t said anything. 
1144,Live in Austin!,Clint," No, I mean what—"
1145,Live in Austin!,Travis," Wow, that was like 45 seconds delay—"
1146,Live in Austin!,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, no—"
1147,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [crosstalk] Jesus Christ!
1148,Live in Austin!,Clint, I was trying to process what he said!
1149,Live in Austin!,Travis, You can’t goof on it like 30 minutes later.
1150,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Carey comes out and she’s wearing track ‘n’ field ge—
1151,Live in Austin!,Justin," Rewind the podcast everybody, I gotta goof!"
1152,Live in Austin!,Griffin, She’s wearing track ‘n’ field gear with a big javelin.
1153,Live in Austin!,Clint, Good call. 
1154,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And Killian is wearing full goalie pads with a big hockey stick.
1155,Live in Austin!,Justin, Hell yeah!
1156,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1157,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And they give y’all a big thumbs up and they kind of stack up on the locker room door. And Coach Taylor’s there and he looks at all of you and he says,"
1158,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Y’all ready? You— you can do this. Clear eyes, full sports."
1159,Live in Austin!,Merle," What, is he staying in the locker room?"
1160,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor, Yes I am.
1161,Live in Austin!,Merle, Yeah. 
1162,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Hey, listen Merle, Merle! This is hard for me too. I got knee— bad knees from the sports. "
1163,Live in Austin!,Merle, From the sports?
1164,Live in Austin!,Coach Taylor," Touchdown Todd is a fickle football god. One minute he’s honouring you with points and scores and RBI’s and the next minute [poof sound effect] your knees are gonezo. Alright 3, 2, 1, go!"
1165,Live in Austin!,Griffin, He throws open the door. Let’s roll initiative!
1166,Live in Austin!,[audience cheering],
1167,Live in Austin!,Travis, Hell yeah!
1168,Live in Austin!,{65,38}
1169,Live in Austin!,[music fades in and back out for commercial break],
1170,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy. Your dungeon master, your best friend, and your… road dog. We’re hittin’ the road this weekend we’re going on a tour for My Brother, My Brother, and Me, it’s another podcast that we do. Thanks for listening to our live episode that we did here in Austin earlier this year. It was a really fun one, the crowd was really fun. The ending almost completely got away from us. Which I think you’re going to experience here in just a little bit. Uh, here in a couple weeks we’re going to be putting up our other live show that we did in San Diego. Uh, which also was a lot of fun and I'm very excited for you to hear that one as well. And then I think the plan is after that, we’re going to start rolling out some of our little experimental mini-arcs where we’re gonna be taking turns running the games and playing different games. I think I have a cold, I think I’m just now realizing that just in the way that I’m talking into this microphone. Let’s talk about some advertisers so that I can go lay down and drink some Emergen-C."
1171,Live in Austin!,"[Ad 1- MVMT Watches, Ad 2- Naturebox, Jumbotrons]",
1172,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Thanks for listening and thanks for tweeting about the show using the ‘TheZoneCast’ hashtag. We’re really going to need your support as we kind of move around and try different stuff, keeping the show going and keeping the listener base strong. We don’t pay to advertise so we really appreciate you all spreading the word ‘cause it’s the only reason why the show has gotten to where it is today, and we are so, so, so grateful for that. Like I said, next week- uh, in two weeks we’ll be doing our San Diego live show, putting that up. And then, after that we’re going to be moving on to our experimental arcs which I’m really, really excited to get to. Thanks to Maximumfun for having us."

1174,Live in Austin!,[mcelroyshows.com],
1175,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And with that, I think with that I’m going to let you get back to the weird ending to this live episode. And I hope you enjoy it, and I’ll talk to you in a couple weeks. Bye!"
1176,Live in Austin!,[music fades in and back out],
1177,Live in Austin!,{{70,38}}
1178,Live in Austin!,Justin, 4.
1179,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Jesus.
1180,Live in Austin!,Travis, 7.
1181,Live in Austin!,Clint," Of course, 19."
1182,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
1183,Live in Austin!,Travis," Actually, 21 for dad."
1184,Live in Austin!,Clint, 21.
1185,Live in Austin!,Griffin, First in the order is Merle Highchorch-chorch.
1186,Live in Austin!,[audience corrects his pronunciation],
1187,Live in Austin!,Clint," Of curse. Yeah, when I say ‘High’ you say—"
1188,Live in Austin!,[scattered audience responses of ‘church’],
1189,Live in Austin!,Travis, We don’t have time.
1190,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Church, I guess."
1191,Live in Austin!,Clint, Thank you.
1192,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay so as you step [crosstalk] out into the gym you survey the battlefield and get a better idea of what this zombie horde is all about. There are in total 20 shambling zombies milling about the room and they’re all surrounding one big zombie in the center. And this bigger zombie is more composed than the others. He’s wearing some armor and he seems to be in command of the whole horde. And all of them, king and horde alike, all turn in your direction as you step out of the room. Merle Highchurch, do you want me to load up all of the cleric spells on my phone? ‘Cause we can take like a minute and Travis and Justin can say a bunch of funny stuff—"
1193,Live in Austin!,Clint," Now hold on a minute. Did king— did coach friday night lights— did he— he blessed all this stuff, right?"
1194,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.
1195,Live in Austin!,Clint," So it oughta be, we just stick him a little bit and he’ll die, right?"
1196,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You can do attacks with the weapons, for sure, yeah."
1197,Live in Austin!,Clint, Well I got enchanted fencing foils.
1198,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1199,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] So I pick out two relatively short zombies that I can actually reach.
1200,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay.
1201,Live in Austin!,Clint, And I stab ’em in the gnards.
1202,Live in Austin!,Travis, Whoa.
1203,Live in Austin!,[audience cheers],
1204,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Excellent. Roll, uh, roll your attack there’s a little thing where it says— where your weapon is. I think it is— yeah, plus 5. Travis, find it for him?"
1205,Live in Austin!,Travis, I got it.
1206,Live in Austin!,Clint, I got it! Plus 5! And it’s a 4.
1207,Live in Austin!,Travis, It's a 9 total.
1208,Live in Austin!,Clint, 9. Except I have— don't I have something that lets me roll twice?
1209,Live in Austin!,Griffin, No you have—
1210,Live in Austin!,Griffin & Travis, —disadvantage—

1213,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Somebody asked for music and uh—
1214,Live in Austin!,{{72.28}},
1215,Live in Austin!,[sad trombone sound effect] [Audience laughs],
1216,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Drag ‘em. All right. You run up and you kind of poke two undead people in their— genitals and they say “Okay” and then— [Audience laughs] The order moves to the next person. Uhhh it’s uh… Carey is gonna take the javelin and just chuck it right at the king zombie. And she rolled a fifteen? Um. [single cheer from the audience] And, this zombie king, as this javelin is coming, actually picks up two of the smaller zombies and holds them up as a shield. [audience muttering, another audible cheer] And so they get pierced by this javelin, uh, and they fall down dead but the king zombie is untouched. Uh, and Killian rrrrrruns up and does worse than Merle on her attack on some other zombies. So. Uhhh, there are fewer zombies now but the king is untouched. Next in the order are the zombies. Ummm… I think I’m gonna do Merle just cause you did run up there I think. [laughs]"
1217,Live in Austin!,Clint, Of course you will.
1218,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That’s a 22 versus A.C. I think that might hit.
1219,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah it— it does.
1220,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [holding back laughter] Somebody said double check! Trust me on this one we’ve been doing this podcast for three years I— know what their AC is at this point. You take 20 points of damage as you are grabbed. Uh—
1221,Live in Austin!,Justin, He’s fine.
1222,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And you are pulled into the zombie horde—
1223,Live in Austin!,Clint, Oh. Wow.
1224,Live in Austin!,Griffin," —meaning you are grappled, also. Taako and Magnus you just see "
1225,Live in Austin!,Merle just get pulled into this zombie horde. And take a bunch of damage. Dad are you going to write down how much damage you took?,
1226,Live in Austin!,Travis, I did. I did it for him.
1227,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Next in the order is Magnus Burnsides. 
1228,Live in Austin!,Travis, Where is the mechanism to open the pool?
1229,Live in Austin!,Griffin, … Oh.
1230,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers and applauds],
1231,Live in Austin!,Clint, You’re gonna get ‘em wet?
1232,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [crosstalk] It’s right— it’s right next to you. 
1233,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs and cheers],
1234,Live in Austin!,Travis, I hit it.
1235,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay! Yeah, sure! You pop open this— this thing, you pop open this— it’s probably a hatch of some sort and there’s a lever inside—"
1236,Live in Austin!,Travis, And I just make eye contact with the king as I do it.
1237,Live in Austin!,[scattered laughter from audience],
1238,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh and it moves quick, this mechanism that uh, I actually did write down. It’s a wonderful life-style. It opens up right underneath them. And the king rolls a nat 20 to avoid, but roll a— roll a d20."
1239,Live in Austin!,[dice rolling],
1240,Live in Austin!,Travis, Twelve?
1241,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Twelve of the zombies, uh, do not save and fall into the— the pool below [some cheers from the audience] and you see them kind of fizzle and burn as they fall into the uh, the water. [Audience cheers] There are now only six zombies surrounding the king, uh—"
1242,Live in Austin!,Travis, I’m going to take my second attack.
1243,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, well! Yeah, I guess you attacked the lever so sure."
1244,Live in Austin!,Travis," And I hurl um, my bat, Chance Lance-style, at the king."
1245,Live in Austin!,Griffin, So you’re just throwing a bat?
1246,Live in Austin!,Travis, You said they did the same thing as my weapons!
1247,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay yeah. Uhhh roll a— [crosstalk]
1248,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] Why don’t you break it first?
1249,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Roll an attack.

1251,Live in Austin!,Travis, Seventeen plus eight— nope! Plus nine—
1252,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oh—
1253,Live in Austin!,Travis, —uh 26.
1254,Live in Austin!,Griffin," That’s good the 25 wouldn’t have done it but the 26 does. Uh, yes "
1255,Live in Austin!,"that is a hit, roll damage?",
1256,Live in Austin!,Travis, Um.
1257,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Just use Railsplitter’s—
1258,Live in Austin!,Travis," Oh, not that great. Three, plus five, eight."
1259,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay he just holds up one zombie who blocks the attack for him but 
1260,Live in Austin!,"the zombie disintegrates as this holy, uh weapon touches— touches him. ",
1261,Live in Austin!,"[Audience cheering] Down to five zombies, Taako.",
1262,Live in Austin!,Travis," And now I am going to uh, action surge–"

1266,Live in Austin!,Justin," [crosstalk] Aww man, I wanted to play D&D!"
1267,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughing],
1268,Live in Austin!,Travis, To attack the other zombies in front of me.
1269,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay!
1270,Live in Austin!,Travis," I thought we’re trying to be quick, that is nineteen."
1271,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah that hits. 
1272,Live in Austin!,Travis," Five plus five, ten points of damage."
1273,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh yeah, with a ten you take out one more zombie, and they just sort of smush underneath the weight of your holy axe— er your holy bat, it’s not an axe. Sorry I got distracted cause I just heard somebody go ‘awwww!’ It’s a fuckin’ zombie! [Audience laughs] Uhhh Taako! Four zombies and the king."
1274,Live in Austin!,Justin, I uh… take my… badminton racket—
1275,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Kay.
1276,Live in Austin!,Justin," Uh. And, uh, I uh, summoning all my strength, I, uh, thrrrrow it… at "
1277,Live in Austin!,the center of his head. ,
1278,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Okay. 
1279,Live in Austin!,Justin, [slowly] I throw my badminton racket at the king’s head—
1280,Live in Austin!,Griffin, That’s not a good job you’re doing I think.
1281,Live in Austin!,Justin," Let me try, hold on. [Pauses as dice rolls, laughs] As it turns out, thanks to the grade I got uh, uh earlier it’s a twenty! Oh!"
1282,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],

1286,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Alright, you throw a badminton racket very hard—"
1287,Live in Austin!,Justin," —uh if we could roll the tape back, I did make sure that he wanted to give me that, so I did, I remember just a [crosstalk] decapitated with a badminton racket basically–"
1288,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] I’m surprised– surprised that this is what you wanted to spend it on. Alright, um you throw a badminton racket, roll a, I think your damage–"
1289,Live in Austin!,Justin, A magical— it’s a magical—
1290,Live in Austin!,Griffin," A magical badminton racket. We’ll say it’s uh, roll a d12 two times. We never use that d12. Nobody does. [Audience laughs] Apparently. "
1291,Live in Austin!,Justin, It’s an eight! Aaand a twelve! [chuckles]
1292,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],
1293,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhhh okay he holds up two— two zombies to sort of block it, and they evaporate as the racket hits them and it goes through and also hits him in the head a little bit."
1294,Live in Austin!,Justin, Nice.
1295,Live in Austin!,[Audience applauds and cheers],
1296,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay. Heeeeee is, uh, has taken some damage. Top of the order again, Merle!"
1297,Live in Austin!,Clint, I cast ‘Burn Undead’!!
1298,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],
1299,Live in Austin!,Travis, Now are you using the Ring of the Grammarian? Because you could do that. 
1300,Live in Austin!,Clint, Do I have the Ring of the Grammarian?
1301,Live in Austin!,Griffin," No, you don’t–"
1302,Live in Austin!,Travis, Awrgh.

1310,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Okay, uhhh, the two little zombies, just, pfffft. Evaporate as you turn ‘em. Everybody failed their roll. The other, uh the king zombie, who is damaged, uh he… just. He just says, ""Fuuuck this!"""
1311,Live in Austin!,{78.57},
1312,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh, and because of ‘Turn Undead,’ has to run away as fast as he can and because of that, he turns and he immediately just runs into the pool. [Audience erupts into cheers] Um."
1313,Live in Austin!,Clint, WAIT A MINUTE! I WON?
1314,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Yeah.
1315,Live in Austin!,Clint, I WON— [laughs maniacally] [Audience cheers louder]
1316,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [while audience is cheering] The king– the king zombie is just dissolving, in the water. And just gurgling and screaming. And Coach— Coach Derek Taylor pops out of the locker room and flips the lever back and just closes the floor back over the king zombie as it goes down. And you celebrate, I imagine, that you’ve just done this, but almost—"
1317,Live in Austin!,Clint, [sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare]
1318,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Oh that would’ve been a good one to have in here too— [crosstalk]
1319,Live in Austin!,Clint, [crosstalk] Oh come on.
1320,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Do I have anything?
1321,Live in Austin!,Clint, How about ‘Can’t Touch This’?

1323,Live in Austin!,horn blares],
1324,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],
1325,Live in Austin!,Griffin," As soon as the floor closes over that zombie, the room… changes a bit. There’s this red ripple that goes all throughout the room. And then… climbing out of this red ripple, uh, a huge form that I’ll describe. Two enormous wings emerge from the floor, and then two hands covered in razor sharp claws pull a long, draconic form from out of this red ripple, and this body is covered in these thick, metal plates from toe to tip, and as it emerges, suddenly standing in front of you is the imposing form of an ancient bronze dragon."
1326,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],
1327,Live in Austin!,Travis, I hit the button on the pool.
1328,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1329,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uh actually that mechanism as you reach over to it there’s a red ripple, and that entire lever just disappears. "
1330,Live in Austin!,Travis, I punch the wall as hard as I can.
1331,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1332,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You hurt your hand very badly. I think Coach Derek Taylor sees this dragon and sees the lever disappear and goes,"
1333,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor, [whispering] Ohhh nooooo.
1334,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And he turns and runs back into the locker room. [Audience laughs] 
1335,Live in Austin!,"Angus is up on the— this dragon is like, a fucking tank. It looks invulnerable. Angus is up on the bleachers and he shouts,",
1336,Live in Austin!,Angus, Sirs! Sirs I figured it out! 
1337,Live in Austin!,Griffin, It’s so weird.
1338,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
1339,Live in Austin!,Angus," I figured it out! It’s not just you three asleep in the real world, in this dreamscape, someone brought you into the dreamscape! All of this chaos is being created by someone in this very room!"
1340,Live in Austin!,Travis, It’s Brody.
1341,Live in Austin!,"[Scattered audience laughter, then gradual increase in laughter and cheering]",
1342,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [laughing] First… [more audience laughter] First in the order is, we’re starting at the top Merle Highchurch."
1343,Live in Austin!,Travis, I mean I’ve seen TV and movies before.
1344,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Here we gooooo…

1347,Live in Austin!,Griffin, I got a 9.
1348,Live in Austin!,Clint, Huh?
1349,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Who are you casting it on? Just like in the bleachers area where everybody is?
1350,Live in Austin!,Clint, Yeah! Up where everybody is! It’s [crosstalk] convenient placing!
1351,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [crosstalk] Okay, Principal Hawthorne says like, "
1352,Live in Austin!,Principal Hawthorne, I just thought Scandal was just okay last night.
1353,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1354,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh… Brody….
1355,Live in Austin!,Clint, Come oooooon. [in a sing-song voice] I cast Zone of Truth!
1356,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Brody says uh,"
1357,Live in Austin!,Brody," What’s happenin’ in here is really good! And I like it! A lot! A big dragon, comin’ to kill ya, everybody? Aww, heck yesssss."
1358,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And he does a fucking grind on the bleachers. 
1359,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs and applauds],
1360,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uhhh next in the order is—
1361,Live in Austin!,Clint, Wait! What did everybody else say?
1362,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhhh… Angus says like, [holding back laughter] Angus says,"
1363,Live in Austin!,Angus, I- I- I drink protein shakes everyday and it’s- [Audience laughs] it’s why I am the way I am and I hate the way they taste.
1364,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Magnus, you’re up next."
1365,Live in Austin!,Travis, Can I get over to the bleachers?
1366,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhh, sure. "
1367,Live in Austin!,Travis, Okay. [laughs] I want to kill Brody.
1368,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1369,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You’d be kind of at a disadvantage if you wanted to like, climb up there."
1370,Live in Austin!,Clint, [laughs]
1371,Live in Austin!,Travis, Then I want… to throw my bat at him.
1372,Live in Austin!,Griffin," [laughs] Okay. [Some cheering from audience] Roll uh, plus attack. "
1373,Live in Austin!,"Plus attack is not uh, it’s not anything–",
1374,Live in Austin!,Clint, Now we need a twenty.
1375,Live in Austin!,Travis," I have 16 plus 9, 25."
1376,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Alright! Uh… I won’t make you roll damage. Umm…
1377,Live in Austin!,Travis, I throw it really hard.
1378,Live in Austin!,[scattered audience laughter],
1379,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You just kinda wang it at him like--
1380,Live in Austin!,Travis," And— And I also want you to picture me scooting past the dragon like,"
1381,Live in Austin!,Magnus," ‘Scuse, uh, uh one second!"
1382,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1383,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Oh yeah I should uh, uh… Attack of opportunity that’s a nineteen? "
1384,Live in Austin!,Versus A.C.—,
1385,Live in Austin!,Travis, Miss. 
1386,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Really???
1387,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yeah. With my shoulder pads I’m at a 21. 
1388,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheering],
1389,Live in Austin!,Griffin, All right. This dragon takes a bite at you and you kinda get—
1390,Live in Austin!,Magnus," Ah! One sec— Wait one second! I’ll be right back, dragon."
1391,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And you “taste my steel” your bat up at Brody and you hit him in the gut, and he… falls off of the bleachers. And as he hits the ground immediately that bronze dragon disappears in the same red ripple, and Brody stands up. And he laughs. But in a much deeper, more sinister voice than you heard before. And he says,"
1392,Live in Austin!,Brody, Well done. You’ve… solved my high school puzzle. [Audience cheers and applauds] But! But you don’t seem to understand the rules. In this world—
1393,Live in Austin!,Travis, I punch him.
1394,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter],
1395,Live in Austin!,Brody," Uh. Wait, can you— can you please wait just one moment."
1396,Live in Austin!,Travis, Uhh!
1397,Live in Austin!,Brody," Just don’t punch me yet. In this world, I’m in control. "
1398,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And then that– oh I think I have music here. Uh and then that, uh… [Griffin makes a ‘boop’ sound, Persona 3 Final Boss Theme starts playing] That red ripple that you’ve seen a few times now? You see it spread out from his body, consuming the whole gymnasium, and he floats up towards the back of the room, and as he goes, pieces of wood tear off the walls and bleachers and up off the floor, all flying towards him. Uhh and he changes forms right in front of your eyes. Suddenly, Brody is the gymnasium. His body… is made of these jagged pieces of wood all suspended off the basketball hoop in the back of the room, just two arms and huge, a huge wooden head sprouting out of the backboard on his chest, and below him the hardwood floors crack and peel upwards repeal— revealing dozens of these just, waving hands grabbing at the three of you desperately. And the wall behind him collapses and the beautiful views of the campus you saw earlier have been replaced with this shifting red miasma that blots out the sun and the sky. And he says,"
1399,Live in Austin!,Brody," I have brought you here to learn your weaknesses and sell them to the highest bidder but now that you know my secret, you can’t leave the dreamscape alive."
1400,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he waves one of his wooden arms at you, and all of your sports equipment disappears in a red ripple. And you hear Coach Taylor shout from the locker,"
1401,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor," Touchdown Todd! Do something, they’re only children!"
1402,Live in Austin!,"[Audience laughter, music stops]",
1403,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Everybody make a dexterity save.
1404,Live in Austin!,Travis, [rising in pitch] Uuuhhhhmmmm? That’s a seventeen.
1405,Live in Austin!,[Single whoop from audience],
1406,Live in Austin!,Clint, That’s a four…
1407,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughter and aawwws],
1408,Live in Austin!,Justin, Sixteen.
1409,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Uhhh. Alright, Magnus. "
1410,Live in Austin!,Travis, Yes?
1411,Live in Austin!,Griffin," All of your gear is gone. But the whole building shakes as he transforms. And the basketball that was stuck in the rafters gets shaked loose. [muffled audience laughing] And falls towards you, and you catch it. And you hear Angus shout, "
1412,Live in Austin!,Angus," Do it, guys! "
1413,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And Taylor shouts,"
1414,Live in Austin!,Coach Derek Taylor, Teamwork! Please! Do it!
1415,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And I had this queued up for this moment? 
1416,Live in Austin!,[Space Jam theme plays {87.08} to audience cheers] ,
1417,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [over audience cheering] You feel a tremendous power in this basketball. As Brody’s form waves off of the hoop at the back of the room.
1418,Live in Austin!,[Audience is still cheering],
1419,Live in Austin!,Justin," I cast Bigby’s Hand? But this time it looks like Michael Jordan’s hand, just like, taking the ball and ready to shove it in. "
1420,Live in Austin!,Travis, I— I do the greatest juke a human being’s ever done and do a side pass to Bigby’s hand.
1421,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Uh okay. Make a— make a dexterity throw. These hands that are up off the floor are grabbing [crosstalk] at you.
1422,Live in Austin!,Travis, [crosstalk] Shiiiiit! That’s an eighteen plus two that’s a twentyyyyyy!
1423,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Alright you pass him— [Audience cheering] You pass it to Taako.
1424,Live in Austin!,Justin, I cast Bigby’s hand—
1425,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [crosstalk] Okay okay okay—
1426,Live in Austin!,Justin," [crosstalk] that looks like Michael Jordan’s hand, and I shove it down his fuckin’ throat."
1427,Live in Austin!,[Audience laughs],
1428,Live in Austin!,Griffin, You reach across the room. Make the most important athletics check of your entire life.
1429,Live in Austin!,Clint, I cast athletics boost on Taako!
1430,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers],
1431,Live in Austin!,Griffin, [laughing] You do! 
1432,Live in Austin!,Justin (muffled), It’s a SEVENTEEN!
1433,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers more],
1434,Live in Austin!,Griffin, Take advantage on that because he cast Bless to improve your athletics roll—
1435,Live in Austin!,Clint, That’s what I meant to say.
1436,Live in Austin!,Justin, [voice rising into an excited screech] It’s a NINETEEEEEN!
1437,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers and applauds],
1438,Live in Austin!,Griffin, I wish I hadn’t blown my quad city DJ—
1439,Live in Austin!,"[Justin, Griffin, Clint indistinguishable crosstalk]",
1440,Live in Austin!,Justin, Let me just get it one more time?
1441,Live in Austin!,Griffin, There’s a— hold on I have a different song.
1442,Live in Austin!,[“Wonderland Round Three” starts playing],
1443,Live in Austin!,[Audience screams],
1444,Live in Austin!,Griffin," You fucking reach your hand all the way across the room with the basketball, dodging these— I guess you’re like— are you off the floor or is this just your hand? "
1445,Live in Austin!,Justin," Yeah, I’m just flying through the air."
1446,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And he’s— these hardwood hands are grabbing at you, trying to pull you down—"
1447,Live in Austin!,Justin, No dice!
1448,Live in Austin!,Griffin," But they just aren’t doing it, and from the, fucking foul line Bigby’s hand reaches down and slams dunks the ball right in the center of Brody’s chest, and right when that happens Angus actually pulls out a wand and casts Shatter, and the fucking backboard just explodes [audience screams and cheers] as you dunk it in."
1449,Live in Austin!,Clint, [laughing]
1450,Live in Austin!,[“Wonderland Round Three” fades out],
1451,Live in Austin!,Griffin," And as the backboard explodes the rest of the gymnasium seems just to disintegrate away around you, and the three of you are falling for a while as the gym is just gone, and you wake up in a— a dark, stone-wrought room. And when you look outside, you, Taako, have been here before. You realise you’re in the Underdark, the drow capital. Um. You’re in a shady part of the Underdark, if such a thing exists. Um. And you’re lying on these three soft beds, um, all lined up next to each other and behind you is a fourth, and lying in that bed is a mind-flayer, an eldritch sort of humanoid creature that specialises in these kinds of psychic assaults, and it’s Brody. And as you all stand up from your beds, he reaches towards you. He says,"
1452,Live in Austin!,Brody, [weakly] If you get dunked on in the dream… [Audience laughs and claps] you get dunked on… [choking] in real…
1453,Live in Austin!,[Audience cheers louder],
1454,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And he— and he fucking dies!
1455,Live in Austin!,"[Audience cheers, Clint laughs]",
1456,Live in Austin!,Travis," And in case you were wondering, that’s how we beat Brody."
1457,Live in Austin!,Griffin, And that’s how you beat Brody.
1458,Live in Austin!,Travis, That’s a true story.
1459,Live in Austin!,Griffin," Thank you all for coming to The Adventure Zone! That’s all I prepared! [Audience cheers] Sorry! [THEME MUSIC ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson begins to fade in] Sorry I did such a bad time management job! Thanks for coming byeeeeeee!"
