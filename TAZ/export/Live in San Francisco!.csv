8,Live in San Francisco!,"[Intro music fades in, audience cheers.]",
9,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Hi, San Francisco, welcome to The Adventure Zo-o-one."
10,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
11,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," I was about to start introducing us, but I… everyone here is dressed like our characters, so I think that would be unnecessary. Uh, so—"
12,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Oh wait, real quick, before we get started, before we get into anything, can we get some house lights up, please?"
13,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, yeah, I wanna see that cosplay."
14,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Let’s see it. [Griffin Woah.] Anybody dressed up?
15,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," If you’re in cosplay, stand up! Stand up."
16,Live in San Francisco!,[Chorus of appreciative “yeah”s from all four.],
17,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, You wild animals.
18,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Now, we haven’t done this before, but if you think you are dressed as the most deep-cut, esoteric character, stay standing up."
19,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [laughs] Boyland! We got a Boyland.
20,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk regarding cosplays],
21,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Fantasy Costco.
22,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, We’ve got somebody dressed up as the Fantasy Costco.
23,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, We got a Voidfish. There’s a Steven up there! Yeah!
24,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
25,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Very good!
26,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Hell yeah!
27,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright, let’s get those house lights off. I’m, uh, shaking... with... fear! [nervous laughter]"
28,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Ding ding ding ding. Ah, there they go, and they’re gone! Just me and my twenty closest friends."
29,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It’s imperative that you all don’t yell things at the stage during the show—
30,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, We spook easily.
31,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," We’ve never announced that at the beginning of the show, [Justin Yeah.] but a lot of people wanna yell suggestions for cool spells… they wanna yell the rules..."
32,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, And we don’t do cool spells.
33,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Well, Justin does. They wanna yell the rules of D&D."
34,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, We used to have somebody in our first couple live shows.
35,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, yeah."
36,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," We actually appointed— what did we call it? [chorus of “archivist”] The archivist. Which was somebody to sit in the audience with the D&D Player’s Handbook, and correct us on the rules. What the fuck were we thinking?"
37,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah.
38,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Seriously!
39,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," We would do an hour and a half, and… 88 minutes of it was the person correcting us."
40,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," We— Yeah. I remember when we stopped, because at a show we did in L.A., the archivist was tragically wedgied to death, and… We’ll always remember you, Dylan, wherever you may be, I presume Hell. But thank you, for all your help."
41,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Also that’s not gonna be a cool watch for them.
42,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Yeah, that’s not fun for them. They paid their money."
43,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," All right, I am in, basically, a corset. So let’s move it along!"
44,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Let’s get rolling! Alright, let’s get started."
45,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, [gasps strenuously]
46,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Your adventure begins, as almost all of our live adventures begin, with a letter. You each received it in the mail several days ago. It’s been nearly a year— [muttering into microphone] spoilers for, uh, TAZ Balance— [normal voice] since the Day of Story and Song, [mild cheers] and still— it was a rough day, y’all, you don’t gotta cheer for that. And still your inboxes remain in a constant state of being blown up. But this letter caught your eye, solely because of who sent it. It read"
47,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Hey, gang, it’s your captain here."
48,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
49,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Cap’nport!
50,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Your former captain, I should say. You’ve all been off my payroll for some time, but I hope you still have some fondness for me, ‘cause I’ve got kind of a big ask for you today. I’ve fallen into a spot of trouble. See, I’ve run up some debts with some unsavory characters all across the Sword Coast, and they’ve come to collect. I’m a bit low on liquid assets at the moment, which, as you can imagine, they’re not terribly pleased about. Fortunately, I’ve found a way to take care of the situation. No, Taako, it doesn’t involve killing all of them in a huge and fiery explosion. I’ve found a way to pay them back and then some."
51,Live in San Francisco!,"During my many travels on the waters of this wonderful world, I’ve found a sunken ship [Travis gasps] that’s chock full of treasure for the taking.",
52,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Harrrrr!
53,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to recover it on my own. I sail by myself most of the time, and—"
54,Live in San Francisco!,"[Audience laughter, followed by Griffin’s laughter. Unsure of context.]",
55,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," And though my yacht is a capable vessel, hoisting wreckage is a bit above my considerable capabilities. [Justin Yesss.] So I’m writing in the hopes that you’ll be willing to sail with me, back out to the wreckage—"
56,Live in San Francisco!,All Three, No.
57,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Fuck off!
58,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Thanks for coming, everybody! Thanks to the Warfield."
59,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Thanks everybody! We love you, San Francisco! [blows kisses]"
60,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," I hope you’ll be willing to sail with me back out to the wreckage and recover it as a team, for old times’ sake."
61,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And money?
62,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Once I pay back my—
63,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," We’re not talking, I just— [crosstalk] it’s just a letter. And money?!"
64,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s actually a magic letter. Like, uh, Harry Potter magic letters?"
65,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Uh-huh?
66,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Once I pay back my debtors, you’re welcome to split the remainder. It should be enough, uh, more than enough for each of you to buy your own boats, if you wish. I cannot recommend it enough. There are few investments in this life that are wiser than buying a big, big boat. "
67,Live in San Francisco!,[laughter],
68,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," I’ll be casting off from the docks at Westbreak in three days. I sincerely hope you all will be aboard when I do. Your friend, Davenport."
69,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, [singing] I’m already there!
70,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Ok, I know what he said, but hear me out, I have another plan. We find all the pirates that he owes money to, and we kill them all in a fiery explosion. Now hear me out."
71,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Oh! Now. [Merle What does—] If I may. And this isn’t usually Magnus’s thing, but... maybe there’s a voice in my head called Travis. I don’t know, random name. We wait until all the pirates are together to collect the money."
72,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Yes?
73,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," And then we kill all of them, keep the money."
74,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I say we let him go.
75,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," If y’all want, I can press control-A and delete everything in this document."
76,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," No, no, no, let’s do it."
77,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I just recently did a game with Chris Perkins, and there was a part where they were walking to the next thing—"
78,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, so sorry, I fuckin’ get it, I’m not Chris Perkins."
79,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," And he said— Well, I just said Chris Perkins was a real pro— and he said as they were walking, like, “So, what do you do as you walk there?” and I was like “What? What do you mean? No, you’re just there.”"
80,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, We’re just there.
81,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You all arrive at the Westbreak Docks at the appointed time and find a lively scene waiting for you. Despite the fact that most of the docks aren’t in operation— many lie shattered, you assume, from the Hunger’s attack nearly one year ago. [mutters into microphone] Spoilers for TAZ Balance. "
82,Live in San Francisco!,"[normal voice] A dozen small fishing vessels are preparing to depart on their daily trips into the nearby reefs. Amidst the hubbub of these preparations, you spot one another near the central dock. I don’t know how often you three actually meet up these days. What is this—",
83,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Every other month.
84,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Wow.
85,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Approximately.
86,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Yeah. Yeah, we get together, play a little euchre."
87,Live in San Francisco!,[pause],
88,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Don’t you need—
89,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Fantasy euchre, don’t worry."
90,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Fantasy euchre, yeah."
91,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Who’s your fourth?
92,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," The fourth is, uh..."
93,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Rotates.
94,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You could name literally any character right now and get a cheer from the audience.
95,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Garyl!
96,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
97,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," No. Absolutely not. Don’t applaud that, that doesn’t make sense."
98,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [softly] You all have to set a higher bar for us. We can’t just...  say the names of characters. Or else that’s—
99,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Maybe it’s the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom!
100,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Stop.
101,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
102,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Maybe it’s the Millenium Falcon! [Griffin laughs] Maybe. Just. It’s something else.
103,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Aubrey shows up and plays with us.
104,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You—
105,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, It’s all one universe!
106,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, I’m stopping this right now. You hear a loud “ahoy!” come from—
107,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Ahoy!
108,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, ...Come from the docks in front of you.
109,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Travis gave us a speech literally thirty seconds before we came on, which was, and I quote, “let’s try to make sure Griffin can get through his introduction.”"
110,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, “Let’s not interrupt him.”
111,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, But then I got to be a pirate!
112,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Then it got to be too much. He’s just bloviating bullshit. Let’s just let the little kid talk, and then we’ll do some other junk."
113,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, I’m loving it. I have barely anything prepared if… "
114,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Okay, fine."
115,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You hear a loud “ahoy!” come from the docks in front of you, from the largest and nicest ship in the harbor. It’s a long vessel with a solid wood construction, painted a glistening pearl color. Two ruby red sails at the center and stern of the ship are raised, though you see some imposing figure on the ship beginning the process of untying their bindings, preparing to raise the anchor. It’s a beautiful boat. Through, uh— Towards the rear of the ship, you notice some patches of unpainted wood covering up some considerable damage, with scorch marks barely peeking out from behind them."
116,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Can I roll a history check to see if I recognize the symbols on the boat?
117,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, ...Sure.
118,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," It’s an eighteen, plus five. So I made ‘em up, pretty much."
119,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, the symbols on the boat— there’s just one. "
120,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Okay.
121,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s a name, painted out n the side. "
122,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Garyl!
123,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And is he able to read it?
124,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He is, it says “The Wavesmasher.”"
125,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Mm. Very good. Very good.
126,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You take it that Daven— With that roll, you assume Davenport has sort of adopted a certain naming convention for… "
127,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Yeah.
128,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, All ships.
129,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," You know what’s funny, in my head? I had the words “Wavehumper” in there."
130,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah.
131,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Oh, I like yours better."
132,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, I’m sorry, I misread."
133,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Did you?
134,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, ‘cause of the font— let me increase the font size. It says Wavehumper."
135,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Okay, good. I thought it might say Wavehumper."
136,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And bounding down the gangplank, you see Davenport. At least, you presume it’s Davenport. A year at sea has changed his aesthetic dramatically. He’s got long, unkempt gray hair now, gathered in two sections in bearded tails. And peeking out from behind that hair, you see an impressive salt-and-pepper goatee. Your once neat-and-tidy captain has become a bit of a sea dog in the year since you last saw him."
137,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Now, does he look more like Dad, or Captain Ron?"
138,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Captain Ron.
139,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Okay.
140,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Thank you-u-u.
141,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And he yells as he approaches you,"
142,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, I knew I could count on you three! How the hell are ya?
143,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Pretty fuckin’ good!
144,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Uh, we’re very well. Uh, h— Th— It sounds like things are not going great with you though, my man."
145,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Oh yeah, the debts are so… much of them. And… "
146,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Yeah.
147,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," It’s gonna be great, though, when I don’t have the debts anymore, [crosstalk] because of the adventure, that we’re gonna do."
148,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, [crosstalk] Yeah.
149,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," [crosstalk] Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
150,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," How come you didn’t parley your world-saving success, and fame and fortune?"
151,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Spent it.
152,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, [skeptically] Spent it.
153,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Ah. You spent your credentials on— you spent your reputation?
154,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, We got paid?
155,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, No. Not as such.
156,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Just the licensing.
157,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, right."
158,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And merch!
159,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Davenport says,"
160,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," It’s just gonna be us, I think. Lucretia responded, and said she’s finishing up Neverwinter for a big reopening ceremony. She offered to send some money instead, which was… awfully nice of her. Barry and Lup didn’t respond at all, which, honestly, I don’t really know what I was expecting there."
161,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Another figure comes down the gangplank from Davenport’s ship. She’s an orc wearing a black duster over a white linen shirt and ratty brown pants, with an eyepatch over one of her scarred-up eyes. She’s large enough to carry what appears to be a moderately-sized ship’s cannon strapped to her back. On her hip is a long cutlass in a plain black scabbard. She approaches your party and she says,"
162,Live in San Francisco!,Swashbuckler," Wind’s finally in our favor, and—"
163,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Ahoy!
164,Live in San Francisco!,Swashbuckler, Ahoy.
165,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, Harrr!
166,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," She says,"
167,Live in San Francisco!,Swashbuckler," Sorry, what am I thinking. Ahoy. Ahoy."
168,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk of “ahoy”],
169,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Ahoy!
170,Live in San Francisco!,Swashbuckler," Wind’s finally in our favor, captain, we should set sail before we lose our window."
171,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, And then she give you all each one more round of the ‘goodbye’ ahoy.
172,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Sure.
173,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Bahoy.
174,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Bahoy.
175,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," You know, pirates have 37 words for ‘ahoy.’"
176,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, And she—
177,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, But no word for money!
178,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Think about it.
179,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Mm.
180,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, And she walks back onto the ship. And Davenport says—
181,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Who was that?!
182,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, That’s Orla. She’s a local merc that offered to come along for the journey.
183,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Sorry, Or—"
184,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, I’m just watching pieces of cosplay just falling.
185,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, It’s really fucking hot!
186,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, That’s true.
187,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, It is hotter than hell over here.
188,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Fuck!
189,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, It’s like an after-party at GenCon in here.
190,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
191,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, She’s a local merc that offered to come along for the journey. I hired her in case the rest of you didn’t actually show up—
192,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," [offended] Oh, cool."
193,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Which I don’t really think you can blame me for.
194,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Fair.
195,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," You all ready to head out? We’ll be gone for a couple of days, and convenience stores are hard to come by on the open ocean."
196,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Um, I assume with vehicle proficiency, I know a lot about boats?"
197,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, What’s the left side called?
198,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, That’s the…? Port.
199,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Port.
200,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You helped him.
201,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I know aft—
202,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, This is not Password!
203,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I know aft and stern, port and starboard."
204,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," After a full day of relatively, and literal, smooth sailing, night falls, and Davenport summons your party below decks for a nice meal he’s prepared. He removes the lid off a steaming pot of seafood stew, which he delivers to each of you around the dining table in the galley, alongside a hunk of day-old, but still relatively tasty, bread."
205,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Magnus is already talking about how the sea has changed him… 
206,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure.
207,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Yeah.
208,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," How his time out here and, oh, the open ocean can really get to someone— You know like, a lot of that."
209,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Ocean friendship bracelets, which is sort of a new concept he’s developed."
210,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah! A lot of ‘oh I’ve really found myself, you know I thought I knew what it meant to be Magnus, but here—’ A lot of that? And it’s all horseshit."
211,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Sure. Over dinner, Davenport says, "
212,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," So uh, how’s life post interdimensional adventures treating each of you?"
213,Live in San Francisco!,Merle," Gahh, the kids are a pain in the ass."
214,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Woah!
215,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Woah!
216,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," That was not a character voice, that was me talking about you guys!"
217,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Charming.
218,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Happy Father’s Day Weekend!
219,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, That’s why I can do it!
220,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Charming.
221,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Uh, going good, I’m thinking of opening a dog training school. Haven’t yet, canonically, but I’m thinking about it."
222,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," There a lot of money in that, ya think?"
223,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Nooo, I’m planning on losing a lot of money that I hope to make on this voyage!"
224,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
225,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Well I’m glad you’ve found something to keep you busy, Magnus. I’ve been struggling with that myself, if I’m being honest. I tried to find more sort of, stuff I could help out with, but, uh… it’s just been me and the sea for a while, which is kind of how I… like it. I kind of know that I’m playing the back nine as it were, I’m a little too old to start over somewhere, so finding some new life to lead just doesn’t sound good to me right now. Y’all aren’t having trouble readjusting now that we’re sort of settling in?"
226,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, [unsure] ...No?
227,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Oh. Just me then. Alright.
228,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Awhh.
229,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Hey… 
230,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," You know, uh… "
231,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Davenport. [Justin sighs exasperatedly] I thought you’d forgotten!
232,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Some people take a while to find their thing, you know? Like, find their stride? Like, uh… the guy who wrote Moby Dick! That took him forever! Lot of words in that one. And that’s the kind of thing that maybe you’re just in the middle of your… dick, and you don’t— it’ll take a while to find your stride, maybe. Maybe piracy was the wrong path and this is the universe’s way of telling you “Hey, go ashore”."
233,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Become a land pirate!
234,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, A land pirate! 
235,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Not enough of those!
236,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, Open up a bait shop!
237,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," [sarcastically] Yeah, that sounds fulfilling. "
238,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," There’s somebody who owns a bait shop in here like, “Awh. Actually, I have a lot of good conversations with fish people.” "
239,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, Orla, who’s dining with you, speaks up, and she says,"
240,Live in San Francisco!,Orla," You know, I, uh, found my life on the sea too, Davenport. I lost my home, it was destroyed when I was just a child, and I found a new home on the ocean. That feeling when you lookout on the horizon, and there’s nothing but endless water in every direction, that’s- that can be home too. Don’t listen to these three clowns who are telling you to open a bait shop somewhere!"
241,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," To be fair, only one of us said bait shop. "
242,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, And it was me. 
243,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Who? Clint McElroy on this boat? Amazing!
244,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Clint McElroy is a custodian on a completely different planet!
245,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, Davenport kinda shakes himself and puts on a smile and he says,"
246,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Alright, well we should arrive at the wreckage at sunrise. You all should get some sleep, we’ve got a big day ahead of us."
247,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Magnus does. Right there at the table.
248,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You retire from the galley to the sleeping quarters except for Magnus, who just instantly falls asleep at the table."
249,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, And we drag his ass to his hammock.
250,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Nope, no, he’s too heavy for that! He’s sleeping at the table. "
251,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Taako and Merle, you find with this—"
252,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Taako wakes up in the middle of the night. And he goes to Davenport’s cabin. 
253,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay. 
254,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Hey, listen… bad news. I think I’ve got scurvy. I’m not sure what the signs of scurvy are. But I’ve been out here for what feels like 13 fuckin’ years, and I’m— how would I know if I have scurvy?"
255,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Well, what’s your symptoms, pal?"
256,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, ...Bored? Salt taste? 
257,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Salt taste.
258,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Salt, there’s like a salty taste all the time? So I’m bored and salt taste, and some mild nausea. "
259,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Can I— show me those chompers… You’re good.
260,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Really?
261,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Yeah.
262,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, You can tell from the teeth! 
263,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, From the teeth!
264,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Like a veterinarian! I never— so there’s the answer, I guess. Well, thanks anyway, sorry to wake ya."
265,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," No problem, I—"
266,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Do you have any limes, though? As long as I’m here I hate to go back empty-handed. Or empty-citrus."
267,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, I got a grapefruit.
268,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Did you roll to see if you had a grapefruit?
269,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, He has a grapefruit. 
270,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, I actually don’t love grapefruit. 
271,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," You gotta put some salt— wait, no, this is Travis,"
272,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, 
273,Live in San Francisco!,You gotta put some salt on there—,
274,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Magnus is just there. He’s just been standing in the door the whole time.
275,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Yo! Scurvy?
276,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Okay, sorry to wake you, I’ll take the grapefruit and try to muscle up the courage to take a nibble. Maybe it’s a “juice in case of emergency” situation, I’ll just keep it on a shelf."
277,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s the following morning. You all awaken in the different rooms you slept in, for some reason, and head above deck, and see the sight described by Orla the previous evening. There’s no land in sight, just infinite ocean in every direction."
278,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Magnus loses it.
279,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Uh-oh. I thought Magnus was a sailor boy.
280,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, But then he’s okay.
281,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, What a rich bit that was. 
282,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Ah, how’s this, Merle starts to puke. "
283,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay.
284,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Yeah.
285,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," There is one point of interest that breaks up this vista of endless ocean, though. Directly in front of your ship, you see a few planks of wood stitched together to form a makeshift raft. Slumped over it, and clinging to the side of this piece of wreckage, you see a hooded figure with its head down, seemingly passed out cold. What do you do?"
286,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Ahoy!
287,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Ahoy.
288,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, [while retching] Ahoy.
289,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Uh, I’m gonna roll a— how far away are we?"
290,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You’re a good fifty feet away. It does not respond to your “ahoy”s. 
291,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Pfft. Asshole. You know what, I’m gonna do a perception check to see if I sense anything else there, and see if I can pick up any other details. And we are looking at a… 19. "
292,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," With a 19, your eagle elven eyes peer into the distance, and you get a better look at the shape of this figure slumped over the raft, and you see that its hand is a skeletal hand, and that it is moving a little bit."
293,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Oh. My. God.
294,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Well here’s the bad news. Magnus has already leapt over the side to go save this person.
295,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay. 
296,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, So I am going to execute a perfect dive. 
297,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," No, you’re not."
298,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Well… is that athletics? Is athletics swimming? 
299,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yes. 
300,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, That’s a 19. 
301,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, good dive, dude."
302,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Was it a ‘phoon? Did you do a ‘phoon? 
303,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," No, it was a sick-ass dive—"
304,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, A single drop of water just “bloop”! And you swim over to the raft?
305,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I leap out of the water like a dolphin and land upon the raft. 
306,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright, you dolphin-swim through the water, and leap up on the raft as Davenport’s ship continues at speed towards it. And, what do you do, you’re at the raft. "
307,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Hello friend! 
308,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It, uh, looks up at you, the shape does, and it is, in fact, totally a skeleton with a bright gold tooth."
309,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, I’ve met skeletons before!
310,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It slashes at you with a dagger at its waist. 
311,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," I get it, I know you’re a little stressed out right now, my man! Stuck out here on a raft while we could be [unintelligible] skeletal friends! "
312,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, That’s a 24 versus AC. 
313,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Eff. 
314,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Ow! Listen, I get it, you’re mad. I’ve changed a lot in the last year. "
315,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It buries a crooked knife in your shoulder for 14 points of damage. 
316,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Damn.
317,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," That’s nothing. I don’t know— I know we probably should roll initiative, but I’m just going to— it’s half— like, it’s a Jack kind of situation, right, like “I’ll never let go,” it’s off the raft, in the water, right? It’s like, clinging to the side of the raft?"
318,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah.
319,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m gonna punt it. 
320,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay. 
321,Live in San Francisco!,"[Sound of dice rolling, someone sucks air in through their teeth]",
322,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, No you’re not.
323,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Well, it’s a 13?"
324,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, No. It grabs your ankle in midair and slashes it—
325,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, No!
326,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Just let it happen, it’s— do it for the vine. Do it for the vine."
327,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It only rolled a 13 on its attack at you, so you don’t have to—"
328,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Okay, so it missed."
329,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yes. 
330,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, [mumbled] At least I probably have something. 
331,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," It’s good to let the vines happen sometimes, Travis."
332,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, I know."
333,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, It can be better for the drama to—
334,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," This raft that you’re standing on, uh, it explodes, knocking you backwards, up into the air, and then down into the ocean. And Merle and Taako, you see from behind you, on the deck of Davenport’s ship, you see Orla, holding her ship’s cannon, with smoke coming out the end."
335,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Nice! Woah, write it down everybody, we finally got saved by a competent woman. "
336,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, and Davenport walks out of the captain’s quarters and and throws you a life, uh… ring. What are those… life preserver, as he floats by and fishes Magnus back up into—"
337,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, It was a skellington! 
338,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
339,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Yeah.
340,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Were we supposed to— I thought it was somebody we knew. Was it somebody we—
341,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Not everything’s a callback.
342,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Not every character’s gonna be a callback.
343,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Okay, alright, that’s cool. The gold tooth kinda threw me. "
344,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Do you know Joe Pesci from Home Alone? Like, what’s the fuckin… Davenport says, "
345,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Okay, so… confession time. I haven’t been completely honest with you all about why I brought you out here today. "
346,Live in San Francisco!, Magnus, Uh-huh.
347,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," So first off, and someone please be ready to catch Taako as he faints, there’s no sunken treasure. "
348,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Taako faints. 
349,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Nobody catches him. 
350,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," No, I rolled a 15—"
351,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Of course you did.
352,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Dexterity, uh, plus 2 is 17. "
353,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Easy catch. 
354,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Thank you so much. 
355,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Silver lining, though, your buddy Davenport isn’t wracked with debt, so that’s… something, at least?"
356,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," So are we just, “Oh, it’s a picnic”?"
357,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, No…
358,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
359,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," There’s an undead pirate ship that tried to destroy my boat while I was out here just a few days ago. I was just minding my own business, it came along, and it was just like, “Rahhhh” and “Bfffff.” I managed to escape and I met Orla while I was drowning my sorrows back at Westbreak. Apparently this ghost ship’s brought down several dozen other non-ghost ships over the the last year or so, so I know I said my days of heroism are behind me, but that’s just not gonna fly, personally speaking. I wouldn’t leave something like that out here, potentially endangering other oceanic explorers like myself who are just trying to find some peace and quiet out here. So, I brought you all in to help me take it down. And I’m sorry for lying, I just haven't spoken to you all in a while and I didn’t know if I could count on you to still be in the… hero business. "
360,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Coulda asked. 
361,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Merle casts Cure Wounds. 
362,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Why? Oh, on me?"
363,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, The idea of Travis— of Magnus being healed is just so alien to Travis. 
364,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Yes, he got stabbed, right?"
365,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, What’s Cure Wounds do?
366,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Cure Wounds, of course, Griffin!"
367,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Get comfortable. 
368,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. 
369,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Go ahead and roll 1d8 for me. 
370,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, 1d8.
371,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Got it? First try. That’s it.
372,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, 1d8. It’s a 1. 
373,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Juicy, juicy. "
374,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Actually, that’s a 7! "
375,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, That’s a 7.
376,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Wait, that’s a 7?"
377,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Yeah!
378,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, alright—"
379,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Ah. What language is this? It’s a 7 plus my spellcasting modifier.
380,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Which is 5 or 6, so we’ll say… full-health Magnus! "
381,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, You’re freakin’ welcome!
382,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers] ,
383,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Okay, but listen though—"
384,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Don’t applaud, enjoy the bare minimum please."
385,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I do wanna say, I went from 131 hit points to 117 to 131, so I had a boo-boo and he fixed it."
386,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," And to be honest with you, I was really casting it on Taako to wake him up. And you kinda hijacked my move. "
387,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Ehhhh, fainting is not a wound."
388,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Well—
389,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I guess this is the time to talk about how I hadn’t lost any hit points. I was literally— the only damage that could have been done to me was the fall, and I was literally caught. "
390,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, if I caught him too hard, I guess? Oh, that’s 10 points of catching damage. "
391,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," I am glad I cast it on Magnus, then. "
392,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Davenport says,"
393,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Anyways, we’re all here now with this pirate situation whether we like it or not, and speaking of, battle stations. "
394,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And he points off the starboard side of the ship, and you all see the waters below start to part. And in the gap that forms, a shape emerges in the water. It’s a crow’s nest, followed by a tattered sail of translucent cloth, and then another sail, and a third, and then you see an entire boat rise from the waters and splash down 10 feet off the side of your ship. This vessel is made of rotted grey wood and covered in barnacles. And yet the whole vessel seems to be coated in this shimmering, sickly green light. "
395,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yarrr, it’s Davy Jones! "
396,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," This boat also eclipses your own, it stands about 8 feet higher in the water, and it’s nearly twice as long as Davenport’s… Wavehumper. And over the railing of the side of the ship, you see a skeleton peek out and give you all a friendly wave, and a voice shouts"
397,Live in San Francisco!,Skeleton," Hello! My name’s Captain Callaway, and I’m so sorry for the inconvenience—"
398,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Ahoy!
399,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway," Ahoy, of course, where are my manners! Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy. "
400,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, Harrr!
401,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Ahoy, ahoy— no, I’m—"
402,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," —asleep, sorry. "
403,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway," Uh, we’re going to need to take your ship and kill all of you, so we can dragoon you into our undead fleet, we’ll try to make it quick and painless, but it’s—"
404,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Listen, I—"
405,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway," It’s hard to guarantee. It’d be actually really cool, honestly, if you could just drop anchor and wait to be murdered?"
406,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Uhhh…
407,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, He is very nice. 
408,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," I will, I’ll tell you what, you seem very nice… you have one chance to surrender. "
409,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway," Oh, man."
410,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Listen, I know! Crossed purposes… "
411,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Is this the talking skeleton? 
412,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah. 
413,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, That’s so crazy. [Griffin and the audience laughs] It is if you think about it! 
414,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, ‘Cuz where’s the air in the vocal cords—
415,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Where’s the air in the vocal cords and stuff?
416,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," And is there, a tongue, like, how do you make your umlauts and stuff?"
417,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Right? Thank you.
418,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Without the lips or the tongue, you just have the teeth."
419,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, He chatters in a rhythm that makes the words… no…
420,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Are you sure?
421,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah. 
422,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, ‘Cuz it’s our podcast. 
423,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, No… We’re actually doing our own podcast. 
424,Live in San Francisco!,[Clint laughs in the background],
425,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, The Bone Zone.
426,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The Bone Zone. He turns to his crew and says, "
427,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway, They’re not just gonna let us murder ‘em. Looks like we have to… do a fight. 
428,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Let’s roll for initiative with that… climactic—
429,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Jim J. Bullock delivery! Wow. 19.
430,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Woah.
431,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, An 11.
432,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, Taako, what’d you roll? "
433,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Um, I’m fainted. "
434,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Go ahead and roll initiative, though, please."
435,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Okay, I wake up."
436,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, (gasp) Scurvy vapors! 
437,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, I was healing him from scurvy!
438,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure. 
439,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Don’t have scurvy, I have a 6 on that one."
440,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Uh-oh. That’s not very good—
441,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," You have a plus 3, so it’s a 9. Jesus! "
442,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Yeah. 
443,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The first thing that happens a long plank of wood with spikes on the bottom of it raises up from the deck of the ghost pirate ship, and slams down into the deck of Davenport’s boat, the Wavehumper, uh, with a terrible crash, and 5 skeleton crew members come pouring down the gangplank onto your ship, and they all take a swing at Magnus, they act as a swarm, which means I roll as one sort of thing for them, that is a 19 versus AC?"
444,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, That’s a miss.
445,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh that’s cool. You easily brush off five skeletons as they swing their scimitars at you— or their cutlasses, their cutli, at you, you carry them effortlessly, and they look very confused because the odds of that happening are just… wild! Next in the order is… Merle."
446,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Uh, Merle casts Guiding Bolt."
447,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay.
448,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, At… Gallaway?
449,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Callaway.
450,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Callaway. Uh, the golfing pirate, so… That’s, um, that’s a sports reference."
451,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," No, I got it. "
452,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Okay, I didn't know. Uh, 4d6 radiant damage."
453,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Well, you have to roll the hit first."
454,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Right.
455,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, 16.
456,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, that’s a hit on Captain Callaway."
457,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
458,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Thank you.
459,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, just roll one—"
460,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Is that Father’s Day pity?
461,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," What— uh, you got that d6 there?"
462,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Roll one.
463,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," I got a d6, okay… it’s— it’s kind of on a fold, maybe I oughta roll it again."
464,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, You said 2?
465,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, 2.
466,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Four, four d6, is what you roll—"
467,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yep.
468,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Roll those.
469,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Okay— god these are heavy!
470,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, they’re metal!"
471,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Travis is gettin’ yolked over there!
472,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, God almighty!
473,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," He rolled three 1’s, and a 2. "
474,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Holy shit. 
475,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Unbelievable. 
476,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Statistically, the second worst he could have done."
477,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure.
478,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, I suck at this game!
479,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It is radiant damage, though, so instead of just 5, it’s 10 points of damage. "
480,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Nice.
481,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, And I have advantage on my next attack roll. 
482,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, cool, okay. Uh, you're not gonna remember that, uh, and uh, your bolt emerges as you read from the Extreme Teen Bible, and it just kind of hits Captain Callaway, and he was like, "
483,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway, ...Okay… uh…
484,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Next in the order is… oh! You hear a mechanical sound coming from the ghost pirate ship, as a panel on the ghost pirate deck opens up, and from  your position on Davenport’s boat, you see what looks like a hot air balloon start rising up from the ghost pirate ship, tethered to their ship with a long rope. And as it raises up 20 feet into the air, you see, attached to the bottom of this balloon, a ship’s cannon, which launches a big cannonball at the three of you, uh, roll a dexterity saving throw."
485,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, 12.
486,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Takin’ a while. This one is a 22 for ‘cha boy Hoops.
487,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
488,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Thank you, I did not play a large role in the outcome. "
489,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Uh, 16."
490,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And Merle, you rolled a… 12? Alright. Magnus and Taako, you both dive out of the way with grace and ease."
491,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I rolled twice because I have the tooth necklace. 
492,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Merle, you are struck with a cannonball. "
493,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I pictured it like, the three of us are standing in a row, it goes Magnus, Taako, Merle? "
494,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah. Uh, it actually lands at your feet, hitting you with a fiery explosion and splinters of wood that come up from the deck of Davenport’s ship for 24 points of damage."
495,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Jeez.
496,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Hey, you cool?"
497,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, it’s a fuckin’ cannon guys, c’mon! Uh, next in the order is… Magnus."
498,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Um… well, how close is the ghost ship to our ship?"
499,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," 10 feet away, you have a gangplank also."
500,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m gonna jump to it. 
501,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You got a gangplank, and— okay."
502,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, But there’s 5 shellingtons in the way! 
503,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Sure… There’s a— hey, hey, hey! There’s probably a rope you could swing on!"
504,Live in San Francisco!,[Audience cheers],
505,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I do that. Okay, uhh, that’s a 17."
506,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You swing and it’s cool. 
507,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And I land right next to Callaway. 
508,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure!
509,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And I attack him.
510,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, How many times?
511,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Six. No, no, right now, just the three. No, wait, just two."
512,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Okay. Uh, what are you attacking him with?"
513,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," The Flaming, Raging, Poisoning Sword of Doom. "
514,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Fuck.
515,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," That’s a 7. Oh, sorry, 17. "
516,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [defeated] Yeah. Shit. One of these liveshows, I’m gonna make a demon take it, or something. "
517,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I think a demon would only be temporary—
518,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Well, I only rolled a 2, so that’s only 26 points of damage. "
519,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," We played the Stream of Many Eyes game, and Travis played, and when it finally got to his turn, he took one battle turn that they literally turned and said “What does your character do?”, and 20 minutes later, when he wrapped up his turn, they were all gaping at him."
520,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And I rolled a 24 attack.
521,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, of course!"
522,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And a 27 damage. So that’s 53 total.
523,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Wait a minute, he may not be done."
524,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," A lot uh, a lot of his bones come off. Just a lot of—"
525,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, He’s de-boned.
526,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, A lot of discarded bones on the ground. 
527,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, And then with my third attack—
528,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Shit-birds.
529,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, I told ya! I told ya!
530,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m gonna throw the Chance Lance at the cannon operator? Or the cannon?
531,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s just a balloon, it’s floating in the air."
532,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I pop the balloon.
533,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Okay. There’s no operator, as far as you can see. "
534,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [quietly] Magic.
535,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, That’s a 19?
536,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yep. 
537,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," So… okay, I guess the balloon will… take some damage? Um, 12 damage—"
538,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It pops, it’s a balloon. It pops."
539,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, That’s why I was confused. 
540,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, You have solved his balloon mystery. 
541,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The balloon pops, and the cannon falls and plunges into the deck of the ship, and it keeps on going, and you hear it hitting a lot of wood, just sort of— it sounds like it’s maybe going to the mantle of the earth that you’re standing on. You also hear it hit water as it falls. "
542,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I just imagine Callaway and I standing there like, “Ooh. Oof. Ooh. Oh.”"
543,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," With his four remaining bones. Uh, next in the order is Orla, who takes her cutlass and engages with the uh, swarm of skeletons. And she engages with one in particular and there’s a cool duel, and she cuts off its head. As it falls to the ground, there are now four remaining skeletons on the ship. Next in the order is Taako."
544,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Um, I hide behind the edge of our ship."
545,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, ‘Kay.
546,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," And I chew a piece of Mockingbird Gum. And I impersonate Captain Callaway as I call out,"
547,Live in San Francisco!,Taako (as Capt. Callaway)," We’re beaten, boys, it's time to get out of here!"
548,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The four remaining skeletons look around like,"
549,Live in San Francisco!,Four Skeletons," Well, where do you want us to go?"
550,Live in San Francisco!,Taako (as Capt. Callaway), Everyone in the water!
551,Live in San Francisco!,[The crowd laughs and applauds],
552,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Your move, Griffin!"
553,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Make a check, you’re gonna need to check for this one."
554,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I got the gum. But I have the gum.
555,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s good gum, you’ll have advantage on it. What’s the— I always fuckin’ fuck this up— deception, make a deception check for me."
556,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, That’s a— that one’s a 2 on that—
557,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," So, you have advantage."
558,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Not good. And a 10. So, it sounds more like this,"
559,Live in San Francisco!,Taako (as a Southerner), Hey everybody! Hey! Let’s all jump in the water! Come on! Come on!
560,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, they do it. "
561,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I mean, they’re dumb skeletons!"
562,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure. They all just jump right in. They gather up the bones of the defeated skeleton brethren and all five of them jump into the water between the two ships. The ghost pirate ship is now sinking into the water as the cannon sort of pierced through it
563,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," So in a sense, it was the most humane thing I could do in this scenario! They were, in fact beaten, and they should, in fact, retreat. "
564,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The water is almost up the deck of the ship, Magnus, where you and Callaway are standing, and Callaway says,"
565,Live in San Francisco!,Captain Callaway," Well, uh, I can see that I’m beaten. Boy, that didn’t… take very long. "
566,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And he takes a step towards the mast. And on the mast there is a bell, which he grabs the ringer for and rings the bell, which is what you do… with a bell. And it makes a sickening, low noise, much lower than the size of the bell… would… make you think it would make— fuck me! "
567,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Tell me more about the bell. [audience laughs] Let’s not rush.
568,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Can you like, recreate it for us?"
569,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, like I—"
570,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure sure—
571,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I figured it would make a “ding ding ding!”
572,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," No, I think it would be more resonant."
573,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It’d be like… “dong-a-long-a-long”.
574,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Right on.
575,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, the sound rings out into the distance, and continues until it is consumed by the waters. Magnus, you are just kind of, in the water now as the ghost ship sinks below, taking Captain Callaway and the rest of the crew down with it. "
576,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I grappling-hook up to the ship. 
577,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Wait I have a— I have a spell! 
578,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Hold on, wait, he grappling-hooks up to the ship. There’s a second act. And the sound of this bell is continuing in the air, even though the ghost ship is consumed, and suddenly, the waters behind your ship part once more. And another ghostly vessel rises from the water, and then two more behind it in formation. And then, three more behind it. Within moments, an entire fleet of ghost ships, dozens of them, are pursuing your boat, all crewed by dozens of cackling skeletons, thrilled at the opportunity to engage in some good old-fashioned piracy. Amidst their laughter, you hear a strange sound come from close by. Here’s another sound effect for you Dad. It sounds like “Caw! Caw!”. Perched on the railing of Davenport’s ship is a raven, a bird not historically known for oceanic expeditions. And then a second raven lands immediately adjacent to the first and joins in the chorus. Then we see a shadow cast over your faces as hundreds of ravens appear, which, uh, fly immediately down, down towards your ship, crashing into the deck of the Wavehumper. And as the ravens fly off, three robed, familiar figures appear in front of you. [The crowd goes wild] The one in the center pulls out a scroll and begins reading. It says,"
579,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," [in a Cockney accent] Undead abominations! By decree of the Raven Queen, we formally charge your fleet w— [drops accent] Taako? What are you doing here, babe?"
580,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, That’s the end of Act 1! We’ll be back with more!
581,Live in San Francisco!,(Intermission),
582,Live in San Francisco!,[[Music fade-in at 50,01-5011]]
583,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright. Kravitz, Lup, and Barry are standing in front of you at the bow of—"
584,Live in San Francisco!,[crowd cheering],
585,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, okay! Okay."
586,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [laughing] You spent that entire intermission like—
587,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," I was sitting there— I was on my phone saying “Oh god, crows, and why… Adventure Zone…”"
588,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [crosstalk] Ravens.
589,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, ravens, that’s why I couldn’t find ‘em."
590,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The three— The three of them are standing in front of you at the bow of Davenport’s ship, dressed in their full Raven Queen regalia. As the three of them realise the situation, Kravitz drops his skeletal facade, and the three of them rush towards your party. Kravitz gives you a warm embrace, Taako, and says,"
591,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," No, no, seriously, Taako, what are you doing here?"
592,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Babe, I told you I was having a boys weekend. I put it on my G-Cal, you know I did!"
593,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," I thought that meant, like, you’d go out to, you know, Reno, and play the tables, I didn’t think…"
594,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, We’re doing that after!
595,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, So is Reno canon now?
596,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It’s Reno…
597,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Renowinter!
598,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, ...Yes.
599,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, Lup says,"
600,Live in San Francisco!,Lup," So, uh, Davenport, bud, kinda curious why you’d, uh, decided to come back out here after you wrote us about all the ghost-based dangers you encountered, my man, didn’t you consider that we’d be coming to collect for, you know, the goddess of death?"
601,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And, uh, Davenport says,"
602,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," I’ll be honest, I kinda forgot? That y’all were… doing that these days? I’ve been on the sea, you see, the ocean makes you forget things."
603,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And Barry says,"
604,Live in San Francisco!,Barry," Well, no worries, we’ll take it from here. You all just head back home, we’ll clean up, and uh, meet you back at Westbreak for a celebratory round of drinks, shouldn’t take us more than five minutes."
605,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Yeah, any help you wanna provide would be absolutely astounding, thank you."
606,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Yeah, we’d like to— I mean, we’re— Can I be honest? Hey?"
607,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Barry says,"
608,Live in San Francisco!,Barry, Y-yeah?
609,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Since that whole thing where, like, we saved not only this universe but all universes?"
610,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Spoiler alert.
611,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Yeah. I’ve been bored. Could we stay and fight the skellingtons please?
612,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Lup and Barry start hovering off the deck of the ship, uh, in this cloud of black smoke, and, addressing you, Magnus, as they soar off, Lup says,"
613,Live in San Francisco!,Lup, You’ll just get in the waaayyyyyy! [voice trailing off]
614,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And Kravitz says,"
615,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," Seriously, five minutes, we’ll be right back."
616,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, And he takes off in a cloud of smoke also.
617,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," [voice also trailing off] Okay, who’s feeding the caaaaats?"
618,Live in San Francisco!,[laughter],
619,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, He—
620,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I just pictured skellington cats.
621,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He yells,"
622,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, Susan!
623,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," I hate Susan, you know that!"
624,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, [voice trailing off] You don’t have to like her for her to feed the caaaaats!
625,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Okay. But don’t binge Queer Eye season 2 without me, it came out today!"
626,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," [crosstalk, voice continues to get drawn out as he gets higher in the sky] Too laaaate!"
627,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Noooooo!
628,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, from behind you Orla clears her throat. She says,"
629,Live in San Francisco!,Orla," Your friends seem, very capable. But taking down this fleet? It’s, uh, a futile effort. They’ll— these aren’t like the undead you’ve faced before, they’re not the defiled husks of fallen adventurers lying in wait in some dungeon, they were— they were turned. They were made that way by something that lurks fathoms beneath us this very moment. It’s the same thing that destroyed my ship and killed my crew. It’s an elder god called The Kraken."
630,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And, in one swift movement, she draws her cutlass and drags it against her palm and flicks a few drops of blood over the side of the boat."
631,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, [crosstalk] Ew!
632,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Storm clouds gather from every direction as a peal of thunder matches the sound of ghost ships exploding in the melee behind you. Waves rise up from the waters in an instant like goosebumps appearing on flesh. The boat lurches to the side and Davenport springs up the stairs towards the wheel, attempting to keep the boat level. Orla removes the cannon from her back and kneels, refilling a chamber with black powder from a flask on her hip and says,"
633,Live in San Francisco!,Orla," We have mere moments to prepare, you should spend them wisely."
634,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Why didn’t you say that before? Why didn’t you be like, “Hey, I’m about to do a thing, do you need time?”"
635,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," She said— she says, uh,"
636,Live in San Francisco!,        Orla," If you knew what was coming, you would’ve turned and ran—"
637,Live in San Francisco!,        Magnus, To where? We’re on a boat!
638,Live in San Francisco!,[audience laughs],
639,Live in San Francisco!,Merle, [incredulously] The back of the boat?
640,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Which is the...
641,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Okay.
642,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Ugh, don’t, please, Christ."
643,Live in San Francisco!,[laughter and crosstalk],
644,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I can’t. I am going to cast Water Breathing on our entire crew.
645,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Okay.
646,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Just a little insurance.
647,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Do you tell people you’re doing that?
648,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," No, it’ll be a fun surprise."
649,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You all feel gills appear on your neck.
650,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Huh.
651,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Two massive tentacles splash upward from the starboard side of the boat. One teeters towards the boat and wraps itself around the mast at the center of the ship just a few feet away. Two more spring upward from the port side, one entwining the figurehead on the prow. From beneath the pitch-black waters, now slapping at the bottom of your boat below, you hear an otherworldly howl. And… "
652,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Are we to assume this is the Kraken?
653,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [sarcastically] No, this is… some other big octopus. You have four tentacles, two of which are entwining your boat. We’re back up to the top of the order with Merle."
654,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, That’s only really half an octopus.
655,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, The other four are doing other things.
656,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, okay! ‘Cause, I mean, a four-legged octopus is… a horse."
657,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," [laughs] Stupid, stupid thing to say. What a dumb joke."
658,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Is it— is it stupid?
659,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Well, no one’s ever looked at a horse and said, “That’s like half an octopus!”"
660,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Okay, but if you put two horses and glued them together—"
661,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, no, I get it, but!"
662,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk] ,
663,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It would kinda look like an octopus, sure."
664,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Sometimes I’m just too deep. 
665,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Dumb, stupid— stupid podcast."
666,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Merle... Merle, you’re up. You’ve got one tentacle entwined in the mast, one on the figurehead, and two more floating in the ocean, one to the starboard side and one to the port. What do you do?"
667,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Um, Merle casts Water Walk!"
668,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, What’s—
669,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Yeah!
670,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Seems a bit sacrilegious to give that one to a cleric, but go ahead and hit me."
671,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface, such as water, as if it were harmless, solid ground. Uh, yeah. Up to— oh, okay! We can all do— oh, we can all walk on water! We all walk on water. "
672,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright, sure! Fuck it! That is your turn, next in the order is Magnus."
673,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," But can’t we describe it at least, how cool it looks?"
674,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, We’re still on the boat! [crosstalk]
675,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [crosstalk] I mean, you’re still on a boat right now, so—"
676,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, but it’ll get there, right?"
677,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [laughs] 
678,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Yeah! Be ready. As soon as we start walking on water, you know who did it."
679,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s not gonna happen. Magnus, you’re up."
680,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I attack the tentacle?
681,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, By walking over to it?
682,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk],
683,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," On the boat’s surface. You’ve got one on the mast, one on the figurehead, and two floating in the water. Which one do you attack?"
684,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, [strained] I’d attack the one in the water.
685,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m gonna attack the one on the mast because it seems like the easiest one to reach.
686,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yep, sure. Go for it. I’m gonna guess it’s, what, the broken one of them—"
687,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Uh, 15?"
688,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, no! You didn’t hit it."
689,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, What about a 26?
690,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah. I mean, you’re gonna add 20 fuckin’ damage to it—"
691,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, 29.
692,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah. Uh, you cleave right through it with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom. A spurt of gross, green fluid comes flying out of the severed tentacle as it falls to the deck of the ship, and the rest of the tentacle retreats. There are now three tentacles remaining."
693,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Now, Griffin, I know you’re the DM and I don’t normally challenge your authority. When the tentacle, a tentacle, was wrapped around the mast, how did I miss it with a 15?"
694,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It was too strong. Your attack bounced off like a child, like a child swinging a wiffle ball bat at a flagpole, like a weak fucking child."
695,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
696,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Fair play.
697,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Is that it?
698,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Yep.
699,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, shit! Uh, next in the order is the octopus. The two tentacles that are floating free— one of them is going to try to slam down on Merle. It was confused by the spell that he cast. It was afraid of how powerful it was. It rears up into the air and comes down— that’s just a 15 versus AC?"
700,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Yeah.
701,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," No, that’s a miss."
702,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, That’s a miss.
703,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, it comes down on you and you hold up your bible and deflect it in the air."
704,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Okay! Can I open it?
705,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Sure, yes."
706,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Ahhh… beautiful.
707,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
708,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, These are available out in the lobby!
709,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, They’re not!
710,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, They’re not?
711,Live in San Francisco!,Justin & Griffin, No.
712,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Uh, this is only mine."
713,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The other one— uh, the other one swings down and tries to grab Magnus. That is a 21 versus AC?"
714,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Where’s the tie— what’s a tie?
715,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Tie goes to the attacker.
716,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Fuck.
717,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You are grappled. It crushes you in its grasp. Oh, that’s not bad, it’s 11 points of damage. But you are grappled—"
718,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I sneeze.
719,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, But you are grappled in this tentacle’s grasp and lifted up above the deck of the ship. Next in the order is Taako.
720,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," First thing’s first, I dig into my bag as a free action and pull out the Cloak of the Manta Ray."
721,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
722,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It’s covered in cobwebs!
723,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Yeah. That allows me the ability to breathe underwater. Little bit of…
724,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, A lot of sort of water-based buffing happening so far.
725,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Redundancy… 
726,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, We’re just so excited to finally have the chance to use them!
727,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Sure.
728,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I can also swim at 60 feet per second, so—"
729,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, beautiful, okay."
730,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," But I’m not gonna do that right now. Right now, I’m going to cast, on the dumb squid who is not the Kraken— is that what we established, is that canonical? Or this is the Kraken?"
731,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," It is, it is the Kraken."
732,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," You said it was another big squid, so—"
733,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, And a squid— [crosstalk]
734,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [crosstalk] I was being a jackass, it’s the Kraken!"
735,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Well then, on the Kraken, I’m going to cast Otto’s Irresistible Dance."
736,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
737,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, This spell is fucking broken!
738,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I’m gonna cast that on a creature I can see within range. It will begin a comic dance in place. Shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering! [Clint laughs] For the duration of a minute, it has to use all its movement to dance, and it cannot leave its space and has disadvantage on dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by the spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it as it dances. As an action, the dancing creature may make a wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself, and on a successful save, the spell ends."
739,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Do you have to attack me, or do I roll to resist it at first—"
740,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," It is a, what, uhh… I think it’s a… nope!"
741,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, shit, okay! "
742,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, It work— it just worked!
743,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The remaining tentacle that’s wrapped around the prow of the ship just unspools, and then… fuck, man."
744,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [smug] Yeah.
745,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I hate to ask to introduce the idea, but… is one of the tentacles that’s holding Magnus dancin’ around holding Magnus?"
746,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah.
747,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Aaauahah!
748,Live in San Francisco!,        Taako," Win some, lose some."
749,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, All three of the remaining tentacles including the one holding Magnus reach up into the air and start doing… the electric slide?
750,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, It’s electric!
751,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, so they just start sliding back and forth in the water sort of rhythmically. Magnus, you’re getting whipped around, back and forth. It’s a violent dance. Uh, but the ship has become ungrappled entirely, and you realize that it’s good that that is the case because it was slowing down significantly and the remaining ghost ships behind you were starting to catch up. But now, you are not in danger of the ships behind you catching up. We are back to the top of the order. Merle, what’s up?"
752,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Merle casts Control Water.
753,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, A little unnecessary! 
754,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Oh, is it?"
755,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, Travis giving me the bird. [Clint Oh.] As if he was—"
756,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Lemme see it again, wait wait!"
757,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, No no no!
758,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk],
759,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, I think Travis even now realizes it was uncalled for.
760,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," It was a real older brother, not cooperative podcaster, move."
761,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, What does Control Water… do?
762,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Merle… [sputters] Gee whiz, it makes spaghetti. What do you think Control Water does?"
763,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [laughs] What’s the fuckin’ card say?
764,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Hoist on your own petard, pal!"
765,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Until the spell ends, you control any free-standing water inside of an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. You can flood, which causes the water—"
766,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Please don’t read every— there’s eight paragraphs of spell [Justin —to rise.] description.
767,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, There’s— you can part the water. You can redirect the flow. You can make a whirlpool. You— you said you were doing that one.
768,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Yeah.
769,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, It requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. I think we got that.
770,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, That’s the ocean.
771,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, You cause a whirlpool to form. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is five feet wide at the base. Up to five— 50 feet— five feet wide at the base? I’m not even sure that would— they would notice. 
772,Live in San Francisco!,[crosstalk],
773,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, This is great fuckin’ audio.
774,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," This is gonna kill him, though, this’ll kill it!"
775,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," This is what you rule people want, right? You want me to read all the rules. [audience cheers] Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet towards it. [Griffin Good.] The creature can swim away from the vortex by making a strength— athletics check against your spell save DC."
776,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, ™ Wizards of the Coast.
777,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," So, you’ve created a whirlpool."
778,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Yeah!
779,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Alright. 
780,Live in San Francisco!,[Clint and audience chuckle],
781,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Give him the finger again, Trav!"
782,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah. [Travis No.] You’re— you’re on a fucking boat!
783,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
784,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, But! I can walk on waaater.
785,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright, we’re doing this. [Clint laughs maniacally] The waves beneath you, they move in a peculiar motion. Maybe the other, the rest of you don’t quite understand what’s going on as a whirlpool suddenly forms right beneath the ship and octopus and all of it. And now, you cannot only see the three tentacles that were above the water, you see all seven of them remaining. And in the center, at the bottom of this whirlpool, being crushed by the water— go ahead and roll 2d8 bludgeoning damage for me. It’s the eight-sided die, let’s go ahead and hurt this octopus."
786,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Seven… six… [Griffin Alright.] Plus… something?
787,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, I don’t think so. "
788,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Okay.
789,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [laughs] 
790,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You see the body of the Kraken. It is… enormous. It is larger than your ship with sickly pink skin, two beady glowing orange eyes, and a beak that is shrieking towards the heavens as this whirlpool forms around it, crushing it. There are now seven tentacles and your ship sees— everybody on your ship sees this— sorry, I’m trying to figure this out in real time. Everyone aboard your ship sees the body of this Kraken as it looks over the edge of this whirlpool on the ship, and then you don’t really need to look over the edge anymore as the ship is then also pulled into the whirlpool, and you hear Daven go,"
791,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, What the fuuuuck?
792,Live in San Francisco!,"as he jerks the wheel to the side, trying to keep the yacht afloat. You are close to the top of the 50-foot rim of this whirlpool, going down. Uh, let’s see what the fuck else happens. I think as it is crushed, it drops you, Magnus, back down onto the boat. There are now seven tentacles just kinda all over, so please don’t ask me which tentacle you’re attacking at any given time, they are identical. And we’re back up—",
793,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, They’re identical tentacles?
794,Live in San Francisco!,[cheers],
795,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Magnus, you are now up."
796,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I am going to take control of the ship wheel and steer the shit out of it. No? I am not going to do—
797,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, you can do that, it’s just Davenport’s gonna be like,"
798,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," [disappointed] Oh, yeah alright."
799,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Daven— Davenport—
800,Live in San Francisco!,Justin(?), He didn’t have money troubles before—
801,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Davenport says, uh,"
802,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," I know about your proficiencies, it’s just I’m the captain, and it feels like, um…"
803,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus," Well, you can command— listen, you can be captain and not steer."
804,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, You wanna do tradesies? Can I hold onto the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom?
805,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Nooo!
806,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
807,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," That’s the only way I’ll do it! I’ll let you steer the ship, you gotta give me the Sword of Doom for a little bit. "
808,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Okay. On one condition—
809,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, It’s— it’s technically mine.
810,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, If you lose it—
811,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, It’s my sword.
812,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, —you die forever.
813,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Well, it’s kinda my sword, so it’s more up to me. It’s fine, go ahead."
814,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
815,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Yeah, I can live with that. It’s a big responsibility."
816,Live in San Francisco!,and he is now wielding the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom. [audience cheers] That’s a… roll initiative for Davenport!,
817,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Nope.
818,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, This is gonna be weird.
819,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Aw, really?"
820,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright, you’re steering the ship. What’s up now?"
821,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I rolled a… 14 plus four, 18."
822,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, A— what?
823,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, To steer the ship.
824,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah. You’re steerin’ it… 
825,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Real good. [crosstalk]
826,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, [crosstalk] Steerin’ it real good.
827,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m trying to keep from getting pulled into the whirlpool that Merle created.
828,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, yeah no, you definitely have—"
829,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Oh, I know what I’m doing!"
830,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yeah?
831,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, Orla! I’m gonna bring the cannons alongside!
832,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," She gives you just a thumbs up and lights a cigar because it’s about to get righteous. Uh, and she takes her cannon that she has strapped to her back and places it into position next to a few others and starts loading them up with cannonballs. Uhhh, let’s just do that now so we have some resolution to this action. She just runs down with a lighter that she has lit, just tss-tss-tss-tss and fires into the crowd of tentacles. She blasts with four cannonballs outward, only three collide with tentacles and they explode, leaving four remaining, getting us back on track for the fight so you guys aren’t fighting eight things at the same time. Okay, next in the order is Taako."
833,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Yeah. Mm, so, you know what, we’ve come a long way, why don’t you describe the situation to me so we all know what we’re—"
834,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [crosstalk] There’s four tentacles remaining. Your ship is trapped in a whirlpool, at the bottom of which is the body of the Kraken which is looking at you and howling with a gross beak. "
835,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," And with the steering, it’s kind of going around—"
836,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, And there’s tentacles in the water?
837,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yes.
838,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Okay. And there’s a whirlpool. 
839,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Yes.
840,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Oh my God.
841,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, yeah, it’s gotten… hairy."
842,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I grab… [Griffin Yeah.] I grab the plank that the other ship used to attack us with the spikes on it. I pick it up and I stand on the edge of the boat and say,"
843,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, You don’t know me. My name is Taako and I invented surfing!
844,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
845,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, And I leap… I leap off the boat on my spiked surfboard towards the remaining tentacles in the water.
846,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Alright. I think on your rad trajectory being pushed forward— it’s like one of those like surfing pools where the water’s like shooting at you super fast, so you are able to just like, fuckin’ carve it, bro."
847,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Yeah, bro."
848,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You are able to get some good speed going.
849,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Yes, bro."
850,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," That’s just your movement. What’s your— what’s your action, now? "
851,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Oh, golly! [Clint laughs] Kinda thought that I— that would’ve done it, you know what I mean? Kinda thought that I—"
852,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," I do like that your idea was not in any way to stop the Kraken, but no, I just wanted to carve! [crosstalk]"
853,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [crosstalk] The spikes! I was planning on carving over the legs with my spikes.
854,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, sick! Okay. [Justin Yeah!] Make a… just make a basic attack roll, adding… "
855,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [laughs] It’s a natural 20! 
856,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Fuck. [audience cheers] Uh, you’re gonna kill one of the tentacles, but why don’t you describe what that looks like."
857,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Taako leaps off and— the spike thing— and he grabs the edge of it and he kinda bends it up, just sort of a stylish maneuver, it’s not necessary, and then he brings it back down and he just carves right up the tentacle and like, carves off of it, does a 900 off of it, [Clint Ooh!] and he just shreds it right in half. It’s really gnarly. Perhaps tubular. "
858,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, okay! Yeah. It explodes and it’s totally sick."
859,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Indeed, indeed. "
860,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Orla from the deck of the ship says,"
861,Live in San Francisco!,Orla, Who the fuck are you guys?
862,Live in San Francisco!,"Next in the order is the octopus. Two of the tentacles— hm, let’s think. One of the tentacles comes crashing down— I’ll give you each one. Merle, one tries to slam down on you again. That’s a two, so that’s not gonna work. Another one comes crashing down towards Mag— where are you at, Magnus, are you still even on the fuckin’ boat?",
863,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Yeah, I’m steering."
864,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, that’s right. 18 versus AC?"
865,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Miss!
866,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Mkay. I don’t know how that happened, you’re steering a boat, not a hard target."
867,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Well I’m wearing a giant-slayer’s ring and I’m wearing armor, and I just gotta go, “Ohh!” "
868,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," The third one is gonna take a swipe and try to grapple Taako as he surfs down the water, and that is a 19 versus AC."
869,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Indeed.
870,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You are grabbed. Do you hold onto your skate— your surfboard as you are lifted up into the air?
871,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, [quiet] I think I do.
872,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Mkay. Make a strength contest with this tentacle. 
873,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," This should go good. Uh, 13 plus, what’s my strength? Zilch. "
874,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," I got a 16. You see the beak of the Kraken open wide as this tentacle starts to move downward back into its awaiting maw. It looks so ready for this. It looks real hongry. And as you are just inches away, you see a black cloud of smoke fly through the tentacle [Travis laughs] and it explodes. And you see Kravitz now in his reaper form, full skeletal face with his scythe dripping with green ooze as he severs the tentacle, and it spasms and flings you back up into the air, and he catches your hand in his [audience cheers] and gently kind of puts you back down, like,"
875,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, Do you want me to put you back surfing? Or were you… where do you need to go right now?
876,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," For— question one, did you see the thing with the surfboard?"
877,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," It was rad, yeah."
878,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Thank you, yes!"
879,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, Very good.
880,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," The boat is fine, I had my moment. "
881,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," He says,"
882,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, You got it.
883,Live in San Francisco!,"and takes you back up to the boat, and you hear Lup in the distance like,",
884,Live in San Francisco!,Lup," Hey, hurry it up! There’s still like eight more boats back here. "
885,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Fuck.
886,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz," Yeah, no, it’s— it’s not going good back there, either, but you all have this octopus situation taken care of? Have you tried using diplomacy?"
887,Live in San Francisco!,"[Clint laughs] And he flies back off. Next in the order, we’re back up to Merle. ",
888,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Merle casts Bane on the three remaining tentacles. 
889,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, What’s that do?
890,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make charisma saving throws.
891,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, How charming are these tentacles?
892,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Whenever a target that—
893,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Depends on who you ask.
894,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, I’m banking on it not being—
895,Live in San Francisco!,[Travis laughs and audience cheers],
896,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," It’s not— no, no, no. It’s not… it’s not my thing, I’m just saying, making an observation. "
897,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, The target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
898,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, What?
899,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, I don’t know.
900,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, This is going to—
901,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Alright, so you have to make— the three tentacles have to make charisma saving throws! Do you not know this game?"
902,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," I got a seven for the tentacles, so they don’t save, and now every time they attack they roll a d4 and subtract it. Alright, well, lemme get a d4 out, didn’t think I was gonna be using one of these little guys. [dice clattering] Alright, I got one. [Clint ‘Kay.] Okay! Good stuff. Next in the order is Magnus."
903,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Alright. 
904,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Oh, no, I’m sorry, I forgot to roll for Davenport. [weak chuckle] You— the ship is now sailing almost next to, right up against one of the remaining tentacles. We’ll say two remaining tentacles because that clock is almost out of time. As you carve a path with the ship, Davenport holds onto some netting on the side of the boat, and, taking the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom in his hand, he says, "
905,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, This thing’s super heavy! You could’ve given me a heads up!
906,Live in San Francisco!,"And as he says that, just kind of holding it out, right, it just very slowly like, bloooop, cuts through one, and then bloooop, cuts through the other, and he says,",
907,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Wow! This thing’s… way too powerful! It’s… I didn’t even swing it, I just kinda held it out and then the things just died as soon as it touched this utterly broken fuckin’ item. It feels like God shouldn’t allow something like this to exist in our universe! And you use this all the time!"
908,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, It’s my main! 
909,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," That’s pretty wild, it’s just— "
910,Live in San Francisco!,Magnus, I know!
911,Live in San Francisco!,"and then bloooop, he cuts through the third one, like,",
912,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Oh shit, I didn’t even— I wasn’t even paying attention that time!"
913,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Wouldn’t it be funny if Davenport dropped it? [Travis No!] And you lost it forever?
914,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Then Davenport would be dead forever. [crosstalk]
915,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," [crosstalk] And you see Davenport’s hand as it hits the third one open, and it faaalls. [Clint laughs] But then he reaches down real fast and catches it and is like,"
916,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport," Wow, that was pretty close, huh? "
917,Live in San Francisco!,"And then a big bird flies down and grabs it from his— but then he grabs it back like,",
918,Live in San Francisco!,Davenport, Ohhh! 
919,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, [laughs] He’s gonna cry.
920,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I am not. [Griffin Next—] But I would and it’s not— there’s nothing wrong with crying.
921,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, And technically it’s Taako’s.
922,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Technically it’s my sword. 
923,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Next in the order is Magnus. What do you do?
924,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Taako calls out,"
925,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," Don’t kill it, I have a plan."
926,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, we can cop out of initiative."
927,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, Okay—
928,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Perfect! 
929,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Do you have a— who has plans? Let’s take a vote on plans.
930,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, I’m just gonna steer out of the whirlpool.
931,Live in San Francisco!,Taako, Perfect!
932,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Okay, it’s… sucking you down."
933,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," [muttered] Yeah, but I’m really good at driving. Ooh, but I have proficiency. Oh, that’s better! "
934,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Okay. You stay afloat in the whirlpool, start, uh, going back up to the top. Taako, what’s your plan?"
935,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I cast Dominate Monster on the Kraken.
936,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Fuck. There’s a spell for everything.
937,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Eighth— it’s eighth level, I only have one and I’m using it on this. Cast Dominate Monster on the Kraken. [Griffin Okay.] It’s gotta succeed on a wisdom saving throw. "
938,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, It’s— it won’t.
939,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," Well, go ahead and roll."
940,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, 13? "
941,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," No, sir."
942,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, ‘Kay. It failed. 
943,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," So now it works for me. [audience cheers] And I… leap into the water, swim to it with extremely fast speed thanks to my radical cloak. [more cheers]"
944,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," You jump out of the boat, actually, and as you hit the water, you just collide with it [Travis Yeah!] because of the spell that Merle cast. You— you cheer, “Hooray, my wonderful cl—” bonk, you collide with the water and just kind of crumple down the whirlpool—"
945,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, I stand up—
946,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, Towards your new pet. 
947,Live in San Francisco!,Justin," I stand up, I dust myself off, and I say,"
948,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," C’mon, we’re gonna go save my boyfriend!"
949,Live in San Francisco!,And I point it towards— I point it towards the remaining ghost ships. Me and my legless Kraken [Clint, Ah!] are coming to the rescue!
950,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, But not for long!
951,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Okay?
952,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Merle casts Regenerate on the Kraken. 
953,Live in San Francisco!,[crowd goes wild],
954,Live in San Francisco!,Justin, Yes! Yes!
955,Live in San Francisco!,Clint, Where a target’s severed body members are restored!
956,Live in San Francisco!,[everyone goes wild],
957,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin, You all have lost so many body parts during—
958,Live in San Francisco!,Travis, So Merle— Merle uses his tree arm to cast Regenerate [Griffin Sure!] on a Kraken he just met—
959,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," No, his tree arm is way more rad than his flesh arm. You befriend this Kraken that you sort of slide down the whirlpool towards, and as you Dominate it, it says,"
960,Live in San Francisco!,Kraken, [unintelligible gurgling noises]
961,Live in San Francisco!,And you hop on its back and it kind of starts trying to flop up the side of the whirlpool [Clint," Aww.] but it’s having trouble, but then you see a beam of light from the Extreme Teen Bible—"
962,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Well, he’s runnin’ along the water, Merle is, ‘cause he can walk on water."
963,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Yeah, let’s get everyone in the water."
964,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Yeah, he’s walkin’ on water and runnin’ towards it and holds it up and yells out the spell."
965,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," And suddenly, all eight tentacles return to the Kraken, and it nods at you Neverending Story-wise. Does it pick up— I’m asking Taako this— does it pick up Merle also as it flies out of the whirlpool?"
966,Live in San Francisco!,Taako," No need for that, he can walk on water!"
967,Live in San Francisco!,[laughter and cheers],
968,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," We— there are— there’s one main ghost ship remaining. It is a dreadnought, the biggest ship of the fleet, crewed by dozens of skeletons alone in this one, and you see Barry, Lup, and Kravitz having a dang hard time taking it down. There’s some big burly skeletons on this one, probably a couple— two mummies? Oh, no!"
969,Live in San Francisco!,Clint," Aw, mummies?"
970,Live in San Francisco!,Travis," Aw, the worst!"
971,Live in San Francisco!,Griffin," Uh, and they are surrounded on the center of the boat, and then in the distance, they hear, [deep] “splash, splash, splash,” and they turn and look behind them and see the shape of the Kraken coming towards them with a figure silhouetted from behind by the sunset behind him flying towards the ship, and right before the Kraken collides with the ship, Barry says,"
972,Live in San Francisco!,Barry, What the hell is that?
973,Live in San Francisco!,[outro music begins],
974,Live in San Francisco!,"And Kravitz says,",
975,Live in San Francisco!,Kravitz, That’s the best damn pirate I’ve ever seen.
976,Live in San Francisco!,[audience cheers],
977,Live in San Francisco!,That’s the end of the episode! Thank you all so much for joining us!,
