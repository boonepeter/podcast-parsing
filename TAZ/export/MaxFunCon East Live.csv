10,MaxFunCon East Live,Announcer [Pre-recorded Griffin], The Adventure Zone!
11,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Deja Vu by Mort Garson begins to play, audience cheering overhead.]",
12,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I’ve got so much shit!
13,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, We have so many gifts! So--and you guys are so far away from me! I didn’t realize.
14,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," But so close to each other! ...Oh, you can’t do that."
15,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, hi everybody! Welcome to the--welcome to the podcast, you’re in--you’re in the podcast!"
16,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheers.],
17,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who here has listened to The Adventure Zone before?
18,MaxFunCon East Live,[Loud cheering.],
19,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK. Thank--thank God! Uh, who here--who here has played Dungeons and Dragons before?"
20,MaxFunCon East Live,[More cheering.],
21,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who here played Dungeons and Dragons today?
22,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Two cheers, followed by laughter from the audience and Clint.]",
23,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Fucking--that’s amazing. Uh, so we’re gonna--is the projector--OK, I can unplug this, then--uh, and uh, we’re--we’re gonna play a quick little one-shot little story game today, uh, do you guys wanna introduce yourselves?"
24,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Or our characters--us or our characters, Griffin?"
25,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, I think of you as sort of a symbiotic unit at this point.
26,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Uh, I am Travis McElroy, and I play Magnus Burnsides, the Fighter. And folk hero. [Applause.] Thank you!"
27,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, AKA The Hammer.
28,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," In some circles, yes."
29,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint [hesitant]," I’m Clint McElroy, and I play Merle Highchurch, and I’m a… [long pause]"
30,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Alright! And Justin!
31,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Uh--
32,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I’m a cleric!
33,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah.
34,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," My name is Steven Amell, you may know me better as TV’s The Arrow. You’ve certainly already guessed that from my pecs and sculpt of my body. But I--this whole time I’ve been playing uh, the elven wizard Taako."
35,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheers.],
36,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And we’ve left a seat open for Elijah! For--for nerdy Elijah. Nerdy roleplaying--uh, let’s hop right into it! Are you guys ready?"
37,MaxFunCon East Live,"[The three respond simultaneously, a enthusiastic “hell yes!” from Justin, “yeah!” from Travis, a hesitant “yeah?” from Clint.]",
38,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Um, so the three of you--Merle, Magnus, and Taako--have joined the Bureau of Balance for a weekend-long mandatory corporate team-building retreat [pause as audience laughs] at a woodland complex called Camp Good Friend, tucked away in an idyllic few acres of the Trollbark Forest. The event was organized by the Director of the Bureau of Balance, who began to notice a slight resentment between the different teams of the Bureau of Balance, uh, uh--"
39,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Jealousy.
40,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," A little bit of jealousy in between the ranks. And in order to squash that, she has sort of brought the whole organization onto--wow you guys are really genuinely far away--uh, to, to Camp Good Friend! Uh, and it’s day three of your retreat, first two were filled with the types of activities you’d expect Seminars on effective corporate communication, panels led by HR representatives on workplace etiquette, some--some bonfires with musical accompaniment led by Johann the Bard, and Camp Good Friend has been fine, the three of you have your own private bunk away from the--some of the bigger cabins--but you’re still kind of roughing it."
41,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Tell us more about the bunk, Griffin."
42,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Well, why don’t you tell me about what you’ve been doing at Camp Good Friend, what sorts of activities you’ve been participating in."
43,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Lanyards! We did a lot of lanyards.
44,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing], OK.
45,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Those’re--those’re hot right now.
46,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
47,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I did a lot of Fantasy Skeet Shooting. With arrows.
48,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Would that even work?
49,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It was very hard.
50,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah!
51,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It did not go well! It went poorly!
52,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Taako?
53,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I slept in a lot and blew off as many activities as I possibly could.
54,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing], OK! ...A nugget of truth there!
55,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs.],
56,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," But it’s the final day of--of your stay at Camp Good Friend, during which everybody is supposed to participate in something called the Trial of Teamwork, which the event’s organizers and counselors have promised to be a completely transformative experience which will change your lives and allow you to relate to your fellow human--or elf or dwarf or whatever--in ways that you’ve never imagined. And you’re summoned to the Enclave of Cooperation, a large clearing in the forest with a stone circle of benches, and just past that is a hilltop dungeon with an archway entrance with a big heavy gate over it."
57,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Now, does this--does this seem like legit or does this seem like paper mâché, they built it, you know, out of something--"
58,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It’s funny that you ask that--totally paper mâché. Like this is like a--this is very much a set.
59,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Great! OK.
60,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," There is a large bulletin board next to the entrance of the dungeon with some long scrolls attached to it. And gathered around this circle you see different Bureau of Balance employees--some you’ve met before, some you probably haven’t put in the effort to meet--and they’re all congregating in groups of four. And they seem like really touchy-feely, for lack of a better term."
61,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Ewwww.
62,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Like they’ve just like. Like they’ve just had this wonderful experience. You see a quartet just sitting--oh god!--oh that had a lid on it thank God--um, you see a quartet on the ground in a circle with their arms wrapped around each other, you see a dwarven woman sitting on a bench with three other Bureau employees just kind of comforting her as she has this like emotional moment, you see--"
63,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Ew.
64,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," --other characters from the show, like Avi, Johann, Leon, and the Director, and they’re very excitedly recapping the events of the trial, and they’re laughing and hugging like a lot, so all around you are these groups that are having these enthusiastic conversations and these emotional interactions. And as you approach the entrance to the trial, you see the head counselor for Camp Good Friend, whose name is Art Goodfriend. And you’ve probably interacted with him a few times throughout the weekend, he’s a very over enthusiastic elven guy who wears sunscreen... which is probably the first time you’ve seen that--[laughing] he probably invented sunscreen in this fantasy world."
65,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs.],
66,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And he motions you toward the signup board, and he says"
67,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Hello boys! Uh, how were your sessions today, did you learn any new life skills or make any new friends?"
68,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, No!
69,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs.],
70,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," [not in character voice] Uh, we, we--the food was good! The food was really good."
71,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," Yeah, except who stops--"
72,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Wait. Fucking stop. Try it again.
73,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, [in character voice] The food was good!
74,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Thank you.
75,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Boom!
76,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Fucking--killing me.
77,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, [voice cracking] Who stops serving pancakes at 9 AM? [Audience laughs and cheers.] I missed the whole thing! I had to get Cheetos! Fantasy Cheetos!
78,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin and Travis laugh.],
79,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," From the--the store! From the, from the uh--what do you call that--trading posts."
80,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin and Griffin laugh.],
81,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," OK, well, there’s one spot left on the signup sheet for the Trial of Teamwork, you’d better get in there while you still can! I’m Bobcat--I’m played by Bobcat Goldthwait a little bit!"
82,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience, Travis, and Clint laugh.]",
83,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You don’t--
84,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," We do, yeah, we do--what did you say? Yeah--"
85,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," You’ve gotta sign up for the Trial of Teamwork, pay attention! I just said it four seconds ago!"
86,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," Is it like, is it a verbal signup or do we need to like, actually like write--"
87,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," There’s a fucking bulletin board right--[breaks into laughter, audience laughs]"
88,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," OK, yeah, do--like, yeah, do I--wait. I have to check my inventory, do I have a pen?"
89,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs.],
90,MaxFunCon East Live,Art [exercising tremendous restraint], A pen will be provided to you!
91,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Our greatest challenge yet!
92,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Should we roll something?
93,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Yeah, do we need to--"
94,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Is there a pen initiative?
95,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus.
96,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Do we need to roll [unintelligible] to see who signs up first?
97,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," We’re allowed to go until 930 PM with this show, right?"
98,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I rolled a 2!
99,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, OK--OK we--
100,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I rolled a 12 in cursive.
101,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," OK, we--we do that."
102,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK, Dad, with that 12 in cursive you write Morple on the board. Good enough!"
103,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin [laughing], Pobody’s nerfect!
104,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, He says
105,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," The other--the other two boys, you don’t seem too enthusiastic about the Trial of Teamwork! Don’t you wanna earn the Teamwork Medal?"
106,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And he holds up a medallion.
107,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Now I do!
108,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Whoa!
109,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," There’s a golden medallion, a golden round medallion, and on it, emblazoned on it, are two big burly arms reaching in for a powerful handshake."
110,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Arms?
111,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah. Well no these are--these are decorative arms.
112,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus can’t sign up fast enough.
113,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK. Magnus signs up.
114,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, He shoves Art out of the way to get to it.
115,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Taako--
116,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Even though he’s not in the way.
117,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Taako, come on, don’t be afraid, I’m just here to help you become a better us! That’s one of my taglines! [laughs, audience laughs]"
118,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I uh, I cast mage hand and make--"
119,MaxFunCon East Live,Art [exasperated by their antics]," OK, fucking great."
120,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, that hand sign for me.
121,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
122,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I’m not gonna--
123,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, That’s technically perjury I think!
124,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Griffin, Clint, and Justin laugh.]",
125,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," The three of you have signed up for the last spot for the Trial of Teamwork, and you notice there’s a fourth spot in this, in this, this signup sheet, and Art says"
126,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Oh, that’s right, teams for the Trial of Teamwork have to have four people! And actually, there’s somebody who specifically requested to join your, your outfit in this attempt! Hey, Brad!"
127,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
128,MaxFunCon East Live,Stage crew, Brad?
129,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Brad?
130,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint [calling], Brad!
131,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering as Stuart walks onstage.],
132,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Hey, Brad."
133,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [gruffly] Hello, Brad."
134,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Hey Brad!
135,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Hey guys, how’re you doing?"
136,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, everyone, this is Brad Bradson, who is being played by Stuart Wellington from the Flophouse podcast!"
137,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering.],
138,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Hey guys!
139,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," It’s our first time having a guest on the show, so we’re all very scared right now."
140,MaxFunCon East Live,[Stuart and the audience laugh.],
141,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Mainly me!
142,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," What’s uh--tell us about Brad Bradson a little bit, Stuart."
143,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," OK, let me [getting situated/consulting character sheet--Griffin laughs]--let me see… Brad works for Human Resources, for the Bureau of Balance. Brad is from a tribe of hill people. His father was Brad the Bloodthirsty. His grandfather was Brad the Bonebreaker."
144,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing]," So he’s sort of gone away from his, uh--"
145,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Yeah, well, kinda! He’s searching for his own truth."
146,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK! [laughs] That’s so important.
147,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," So his enemies know him as Brad the Motivator. And that’s what I’m here to do today, guys!"
148,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And I wanna--I’m curious if you all have met Brad before, if you’ve had any interactions with Human Resources."
149,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, I--I keep getting notes from someone named Brad but it’s a mystery to me.
150,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, There was one office Christmas party but I think we both wanna forget it right now.
151,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK! Taako?
152,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, No.
153,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin bursts into laughter.],
154,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Brad, have you heard of these three before?"
155,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Oh, I’ve heard plenty about these three."
156,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK! Uh, Brad Bradson, you walk over and sign up on the signup sheet, and finally you have a full team! And uh, Art Goodfriend leads you towards the, the cobblestone archway into the hilltop dungeon, and as you walk over there, the gate opens up, and you see a few familiar faces--you see Carey and Killian, and Noelle and Angus emerge from the archway, and Angus is riding on Noelle’s robot shoulders [audience coos] and they’re just--they’re all just having a great time! Their faces are, are, are streaked with tears of joy, and they’re just like excitedly retelling what happened in the dungeon below! And Carey says"
157,MaxFunCon East Live,Carey, Oh my god! Taako! You gotta get in there! It’s--it’s life-changing stuff! Hey Bill!
158,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And walks past the group. 
159,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Say, uh, careful guys, don’t fall off her shoulders."
160,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin and the audience laugh.],
161,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Wait, are you HR or are you a safety inspector?"
162,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," It’s a little bit of both, you know? [Travis laughs.]"
163,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Angus says
164,MaxFunCon East Live,Angus, Hello sirs!
165,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Eugh.
166,MaxFunCon East Live,Angus, I’m excited for what you’re gonna--I’m excited for what you’re going to learn about in there!
167,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, High five!
168,MaxFunCon East Live,Angus, Vis a vis treating your coworkers nicer!
169,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin and the audience laugh.],
170,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, High five!
171,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Weeell, I was about to do a thing, but now maybe not."
172,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, If we kill anybody is it canon?
173,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus.
174,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs.],
175,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Well I’m just saying!
176,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Ango is still a child!
177,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, So the gate--
178,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You heard it here first! Clint McElroy will kill a child for humor!
179,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, The gate opens again and Art motions you inside and says
180,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Good luck! And great teamwork!
181,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis [making fun of his voice], I’m melting!
182,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs.],
183,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, We could literally be walking into a dragon’s maw and it’d be better than spending another fucking second with Art.
184,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs.],
185,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, We do that! We walk into the dragon’s maw!
186,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
187,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," I think Art’s pretty great actually, guys."
188,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, OK.
189,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, It’s a two dollar cover.
190,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," There uh, before you’re allowed to go in, there’s a deposit box where you have to drop off all of your magic items. Not your weapons, you still get to keep those, but you don’t get to keep any of your magic--"
191,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I printed out a whole list!
192,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint [laughing]," I know, he’s got a whole sheet of stuff in his bag!"
193,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," To be fair,"
194,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin throws the sheet into the crowd.],
195,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, And now it’s gone.
196,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Anything in Magnus’s hands is--
197,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Collector’s item.
198,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs.],
199,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Did you sign it?
200,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Wait! Did I put any in my butt? Hey! Can I put--are there any of those that could’ve fit in my butt? You just check and let me know later.
201,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Is there anything he can hoop?
202,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," It didn’t come out of his butt, it’s OK to open it!"
203,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I sneak it into my butt.
204,MaxFunCon East Live,Audience member, This list is huge!
205,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Yeah, I’ve been keeping a lot of items. Not all in my butt."
206,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs.],
207,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Enough to make him walk funny.
208,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," So you move through the archway and into a small round chamber,"
209,MaxFunCon East Live,Audience member," Pocket spa, maybe?"
210,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Pocket spa, do you wanna shove a tent in your ass?"
211,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs.],
212,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Hey, don’t yuck his yum!"
213,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Let’s abandon this plan!
214,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, I don’t wanna yuck any yums, do you wanna put a pop tent in your butt? Alright, let’s move on, let’s move on. You move on through the archway and into a small round chamber, the only thing of note in here is a small design carved onto the stone floor that reads “Enter Colleagues, Exit Best Friends”."
215,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, God. Almighty.
216,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And ahead of you is a long narrow--ahead of you is a long narrow stone staircase leading down a tunnel down into the hill and underground, and as you move down it, there’s a surprisingly warm breeze blowing up the stairs."
217,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus starts running towards the breeze.
218,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
219,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It’s literally a breeze!
220,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, He’s running!
221,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It’s wind! OK--
222,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Can’t stop him!
223,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Are you--are you like, an excitable man or a monarch butterfly?! [Griffin laughs.] Like literally!"
224,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And as you, uh, finish your descent down these long, narrow stairs, you emerge into a large room lit by several huge sconces built into the wall, and it is kind of a shitty room! It’s uh, it’s about the size of a cellar, and it’s kind of decorated in like, paper mâché dungeon attire, like it looks like a theatre set designed to look like a--or like a spooky haunted house, like a lot of, a lot of hard--what’s that hard foam that you spray and it makes it look like--"
225,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Hard foam.
226,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you got it. So yeah, you’re in basically a fake dungeon."
227,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus walks around for a while just poking his finger through stuff.
228,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you can, like you walk to the paper mâché wall and it just goes boink! [Travis giggles.] straight through it. And uh, as you enter this large chamber--"
229,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," People--people worked on that room, Magnus!"
230,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, OK!
231,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint and Griffin laugh.],
232,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," This is gonna be great. As you enter the chamber, the portcullis drops behind you, preventing your exit from the Trial of Teamwork."
233,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I wanna do a strength check to pick it back up.
234,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing], OK?
235,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, There’s a six?
236,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing], Nooo.
237,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Plus! Eight. So, a fourteen!"
238,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Jesus, plus eight? Yeah, you could get out if you wanted to. [He breaks into laughter; Clint laughs too.]"
239,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I do that a couple times just [miming picking the portcullis up] ehh? Ehh? OK.
240,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And let’s get into the first trial! So, you’re standing in front of the first trial, and about 6 inches off the ground is a series of five 6½ foot long planks of wood, the ends of which are resting on small, circular metal pegs built into the ground, they make a zigzag pattern over a span of 30 feet, and you notice that below this series of planks, or essentially this low ropes course, is red carpet. And above you, you hear a loudspeaker being activated and you hear Art’s voice through the loudspeaker. And he says, uh, oh I should"
241,MaxFunCon East Live,[He cups his hands over his mouth to simulate the sound of a loudspeaker],
242,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, For your first trial--
243,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, What?
244,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Un-unintelligible.
245,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Huh?
246,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, you really can’t hear that?"
247,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Yeah.
248,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, No.
249,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Well, imagine a little loudspeaker effect. Can you do that in post? Do you have a knob over there that’s like, loudspeaker--?"
250,MaxFunCon East Live,Stage crew, Yeah.
251,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," As his voice comes through these loudspeakers,"
252,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," I got a thumbs up--I got a thumbs up, I don’t see any knobs twiddling over there! So, over the loudspeaker, you hear"
253,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," For your first trial, your whole team has to cross the planks to the other side! But be careful! ‘Cause the floor is lava!"
254,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter.],
255,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus pokes the red carpet.
256,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Don’t touch the lava! Unless you wanna earn Teamwork Penalties!
257,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, It’s not lava--it’s not lava! It’s a carpet!
258,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, OK!
259,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And the loudspeaker clicks off.
260,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus goes running across the planks or whatever.
261,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK, make an acrobatics roll."
262,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin laughs as Travis rolls.],
263,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Eight. Plus. Two.
264,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," A ten is actually OK, you’re just running all the way across?"
265,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Yeah.
266,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK, Magnus has crossed the bridge by himself!"
267,MaxFunCon East Live,[Scattered audience applause.],
268,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, How big are like the gaps in between--like how big of a--?
269,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," They’re not--there’s not that big a gap, it’s just--"
270,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin [laughing], So it’s just like a bridge?
271,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Well, the boards are pretty narrow, so you gotta be careful or else you’ll step in the [singsong] laaavaaa."
272,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
273,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Is there room to walk around the sides?
274,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, I mean the planks are, are wide enough to like, you could hang out there for a second if you wanted to."
275,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," But is there like, empty floor space on the sides?"
276,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No, it’s lava baby, lava all over."
277,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Is it really lava?
278,MaxFunCon East Live,[Stuart laughs.],
279,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Yeah, yeah, is it really lava?"
280,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing]," Uh, no, it’s uh, red carpet on the floor!"
281,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Well, Merle walks across the red car--no, he doesn’t. Jumps across the red carpet!"
282,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You’re gonna jump thirty horizontal feet?
283,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I am gonna jump! Yes!
284,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, make an--make--make an athletics roll!"
285,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, OK!
286,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," To jump--to jump--hey, Dad? To jump 30 horizontal feet. [Justin giggles in the background as the audience uproariously laughs.]"
287,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You can do it!
288,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Did you know they just set a new world record in the Olympics for the long jump? For like fucking 8?
289,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin [laughing], And the Olym--and the Olympics are--for humans! [audience laughter]
290,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, But go ahead and do it! [Justin bursts into laughter.] Because you said it! Go ahead and roll your 30--
291,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint [yelling], OK! Screw you! I will!
292,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Nope.
293,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, What am I looking at?
294,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Not any of this.
295,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Just roll a d20, you always just roll a d20!"
296,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Yeah, but I gotta know what my amplifier is--"
297,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You have a plus 0.
298,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Plus 0?!
299,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Plus 0! Perfect baby! Yeah! Let them bones roll!
300,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis [chanting], Crit! Crit! Crit! Crit!
301,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Yeah!
302,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s an 8!
303,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, It’s an--I can read! It’s an 8.
304,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You jump--
305,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," But on a sideways it’s infinity which is the roll he would need [breaking into laughter, audience cheers and claps] to get to actually make the jump!"
306,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Nailed it!
307,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin [yelling]," To jump 30 horizontal feet, Clinton!"
308,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You jump--you jump 5½ feet and you land right on the carpet, like one sixth of the way past this trial."
309,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh! No, I was jumping over where the plank is! So I landed on the plank at some point."
310,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Bullshit you did! Make the best acrobatics roll of your life and I’ll see if you land on the plank! There it goes.
311,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Do it.
312,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Here it goes!
313,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I think he’s gonna do it!
314,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Now we’re playing D&D, baby!"
315,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Roll!
316,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint [rolling], Yeah! Rolled a… hey!
317,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s a 17.
318,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Just read it.
319,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, 17 and I add a 0.
320,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK. OK, yeah, that’s enough--you land on your belly on the plank like, like this like, inches from the red carpet, but you didn’t, you didn’t--"
321,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, So like right out of America’s Funniest Videos?
322,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, But you cleared like one board!
323,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, OK!
324,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I start clapping.
325,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
326,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," That’s a great first try, Merle! Well done!"
327,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Thank you! Thank you very much, Bart!"
328,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," This is like, really easy! You just walk across ‘em!"
329,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, Where’s the fun in that?
330,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, OK. We have like a whole show to do.
331,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Somebody else do something!
332,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I start tearing up pieces of paper in the shape of the logs and I put ‘em on the floor and start trying to arrange them in a puzzle.
333,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Fuck yeah! Whatever, whatever you roll to get across it, you have advantage on."
334,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Oh, advantage! Uh, I’m gonna say insight, and that is--"
335,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin [laughing]," Wait, no! OK! No! I mean, you just have whatever you use to cross the bridge, you can’t use insight to cross the--I see you, bridge!"
336,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Oh! I don’t know!
337,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, I was thinking of advantage on whatever you do to get across the bridge.
338,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, He has two! He’s got two of ‘em!
339,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, he’s got advantage, that’s what it means, we’ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons for two years!"
340,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Then I will hold onto my clipboard and run across those boards--
341,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Are you fucking jumping over Merle?
342,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Uh, yeah! No, I mean, I’ll tap him on the shoulder and say “great job” and then keep running."
343,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
344,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, And I’ll raise up at the worst possible moment--whack!
345,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, While this is all going on I cast fucking levitate on myself
346,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK.
347,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, and I float across the lava like a grown man.
348,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK!
349,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience applause.],
350,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Or in this case, elf."
351,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It is effortless.
352,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I guess, as the case may be."
353,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It is effortless. Woop! Taako just goes across.
354,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I got a 17 for my athletics roll.
355,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK! Yeah, and you’re--what’re you doing? What is the--interaction between Merle and you on the bridge?"
356,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I say
357,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You did a wonderful job, Merle, keep going."
358,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," And with that encouragement, I clear the rest of the planks."
359,MaxFunCon East Live,[Stuart laughs.],
360,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, no, you can make another acrobatics roll to finish crossing the rest of it."
361,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, How far--
362,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, He should get advantage on it because that was very motivational!
363,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Yeah!
364,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you--the check will be lower than 10, I’ll say that."
365,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, OK!
366,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Between the--
367,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Thank God! … But I have advantage, though, didn’t that--"
368,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Nooo.
369,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No dawg, what’d you roll?"
370,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Can I enhance his ability with Enhance Ability?
371,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, sure!"
372,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I enhance his ability.
373,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, What does it mean?
374,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Uhh, I think he has--wait. Uh, he has… uh… [singsong] wait a second following effects some kind of thing that I don’t know!"
375,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis [laughing]," It doesn’t say anything great, Brad!"
376,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, You didn’t fill out my damn card! I guess it gives him advantage.
377,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, your acrobatic--wait, and roll your--do you have an instrument? What is your instrument, Brad the Bard?"
378,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, It’s oratory.
379,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin breaks into laughter.],
380,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Clearly!
381,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Brad did a lot of speech and debate in high school!
382,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, So when you--when you--so this whole time when you’re like ‘hey keep it up!’ that’s literally you casting magic spells.
383,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Exactly!
384,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," That’s fucking amazing. OK, so, roll it again, and you have a plus 2 on your roll."
385,MaxFunCon East Live,[Long pause as Clint rolls.],
386,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s a 14.
387,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Do you want different dice? I love you very much. Do you--
388,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Do you need different eyeballs?!
389,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I don’t have my glasses! Fourteen!
390,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Could you please pass my dad his glasses? Thank you.
391,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Thank you, honey."
392,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, There you go.
393,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, We’ll be here all day.
394,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It’s a family show. I already know it’s a 14 plus--
395,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Hey look, it’s the Spectacles of You Should’ve Had Those In The First Place!"
396,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh yeah, that’s part of the costume--"
397,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, The legendary spectacles!
398,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, 14!
399,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, you make it across the bridge. All of you have cleared the first Trial of Teamwork!"
400,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheers.],
401,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Thank you.
402,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Without manifesting a single shred of teamwork!
403,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Well, that’s not true!"
404,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Except for Brent.
405,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Over the--over the loudspeaker-- [break for audience laughter]
406,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Almost right on the first try, it’s Brad, you’ll get it next time."
407,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Brad.
408,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs.],
409,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Onward! Magnus runs ahead!
410,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Woo!
411,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Over the loudspeaker you hear
412,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Well that was a… decent job, but two of you did cross without using any teamwork at all so I’m afraid you’ve incurred one Teamwork Penalty!"
413,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Yaaay!
414,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, Nooo!
415,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Um, I could use a pen if anybody has one? It’s not important, but uh, I just need a pen--well, you’ll need that pen for--yeah, that’s great, can I borrow that? Thank you! I’ll return it."
416,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, No he won’t.
417,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," I need to keep track of your Teamwork Penalties. TPs 1. Uh, OK! He says"
418,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Do you guys know what that trial was supposed to teach you?
419,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, No!
420,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, No.
421,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, You don’t wanna wager a guess about what the trial was supposed to mean?
422,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, The floor is lava!
423,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, Not criticizing your parents!
424,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter.],
425,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, That’s not a bad lesson!
426,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uh, I was about to say using character voices, but he kinda cut my legs out from underneath me on that one."
427,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, [exaggerated] Not using character voices!
428,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," No, it’s supposed to mean that we all walk the same path in life and it’s easier with help with your friends!"
429,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience coos.],
430,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Bleh.
431,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs.],
432,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," Alright, next challenge!"
433,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] OK! You are on the second trial, and you’re standing in front of a smooth wooden wall. It’s about 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide. It’s several feet deep as well, and those are the dimensions of the wall, everybody! And um, it’s built--it’s built into the floor and it’s pretty sturdy and the loudspeaker clicks on and you hear Art say"
434,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, For this challenge you have to help each other up and over the wall! Make sure you don’t leave your guys behind!
435,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Your dies?
436,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Can I jump up it?
437,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin (incredulous), What the fuck is wrong with you guys not understanding jumping abilities?!
438,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, 15 feet isn’t that much!
439,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, 15 feet is one and a half stories!
440,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I almost did 30!
441,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Here’s what I’m gonna do! I’m gonna jump and then plant Railsplitter in and pull myself the rest of the way up.
442,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK, yeah, that works. Then actually this would be--make an attack roll on the wall. This should be better for you!"
443,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That’s a 5 plus 9. 14.
444,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," I mean it’s a wall, so yeah, you get a--"
445,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s not gonna dodge!
446,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You jump and get it in there and then uh, make a, make an athletics roll to finish climbing the rest of the way up."
447,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin gentle beatboxing as rolling and math happens],
448,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, 13?
449,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you’re good. Uh, you, uh--"
450,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Plus 8! 21!
451,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You manage to go up. Quick question though, do you take the axe with you?"
452,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Yeah! I’m not fucking leaving Railsplitter down there!
453,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin (delighted), Fucking wonderful. You take this handle that you installed in the wall for yourself and you reach the top of the wall by yourself!
454,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I’m. I might drop a rope?
455,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You don’t have any items with you other than your weapons.
456,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Not even a- you said magic items! I don’t have a rope?
457,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Ropes are pretty magical if you think about it! You can tie two things together, you can--there’s all kinds of stuff you can do with a rope!"
458,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," [crosstalk] OK, I lay down--I lay down on my stomach and kinda, y’know, lower an arm down."
459,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, that’s really sweet of you. Uh, OK, uh, what’s everybody else doing?"
460,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, What’s the--what’s the wall made out of?
461,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Wood.
462,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, And we’ve gotta go--what now--13 feet up?
463,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I’ve got about 3--
464,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, How long are your arms?!
465,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, Oh now hold on everybody! I got it! No problem!
466,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I cast Reduce. Which is second-level transmutation, on the wall!"
467,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK!
468,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin and the audience laugh.],
469,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, OK! You--you are reducing--what does that do?
470,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I mean, I can cause an object within range to grow smaller or larger for the duration."
471,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Does it say how small--how small are you making this wall?
472,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Uh--
473,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Better make it about 2 feet.
474,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, It literally doesn’t say.
475,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, then you tell me, dawg! How big’s the wall now?"
476,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," It’s, uh. It’s two feet tall. Just enough to be adorable."
477,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Like a Malibu Barbie Dream House.
478,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Now everybody gets over the wall.
479,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OK, uh… OK, you shrink the--"
480,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Well, fuck me, I guess!"
481,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you shrink--yeah, here’s a, fuck you double, the wall shrinks very fast and Magnus, you like, you were on your chest when it shrinks, and so when the wall just is suddenly 8 feet shorter, you fall 8 feet and land on your ribs on the corner of the wooden wall and you take 7 damage!"
482,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience laughs, claps.]",
483,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Can I see your pen, Brad?"
484,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I was trying to do good!
485,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, OK! The wall is now 2 feet tall, you can. Now, just because you guys have some trouble with spatial stuff, that’s tall enough to climb over easily."
486,MaxFunCon East Live,{~28,53}
487,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
488,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," As I climb over I rub Magnus’s shoulder and whisper,"
489,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Feel better, friend!"
490,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, And cast Healing Word.
491,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Oh nice!
492,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience awws],
493,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [incredulously, talking over Stuart] Is this what it’s like to play Dungeon and Dragons with a competent person!?"
494,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, We’re doing great guys!
495,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, okay."
496,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Oh, we are so gonna let you die. Nothin’ personal."
497,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, If that’s my truth; so be it.
498,MaxFunCon East Live,[All laughing and exclaiming],
499,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [Laughing] Wait! Holy shit!
500,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Hold on!
501,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Brad, that’s how deep it goes? That’s how deep your well of motivation goes?"
502,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, You gotta trust in the universe to provide. Death sometimes.
503,MaxFunCon East Live,[All laughing],
504,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay. Uh, you, uh, you, you clear this wall, and--"
505,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I haven’t cleared it yet.
506,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, okay. It’s two feet tall. What are you doing?"
507,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Let’s make a fuckin’ three act play out of it.
508,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I wanna jump over it!
509,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," All right, you’re jumpin’ over it, here we go!"
510,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Three.
511,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [echoes] Three.
512,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [slightly annoyed] You fuckin’ hit your feet on the wall and you fall over it and land on your face for four damage.
513,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience hooting, laughing]",
514,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [muffled] So bad!
515,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Taako.
516,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Try to have a little panache...
517,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [weary from the depths of his soul] What. What?
518,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, What do you do? Do you just…
519,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [exasperated] I walk over the wall that I shrunk. With magic.
520,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright. Uh, you, uh. You make it over the wall."
521,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," And I can’t-- I literally, not a joke, kick Merle in his fuckin’ ribs, ‘cause I’m so, so angry at him. But I have a soft shoe. It’s not damage inducing, just-- I’m so mad."
522,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
523,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I can live with it.
524,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I trip-- I trip Taako as he goes over for hurting my ribs.
525,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Griffin, audience laughing]",
526,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] Oh god. Alright. Alright. Taako, Taako, [laughing] make a dexterity saving throw."
527,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s a seven.
528,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, you fall over!"
529,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Plus!
530,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Plus!
531,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Plus! Three.
532,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, okay, I’d say that does it. Ten, ten’ll clear it."
533,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [sucks teeth] A little stumble, but I regain my balance."
534,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you’re fine. Uh."
535,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I’m taking a lot of notes at this point.
536,MaxFunCon East Live,{~30,56}
537,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah… Art actually chimes in, he’s like"
538,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," You guys know you earned a teamwork penalty for that one,  right? You know I don’t have to tell you,"
539,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah."
540,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Like three of you actively hurt other people.
541,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," We did start off well though, there was, like we know there was,"
542,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," [crosstalk] No, there was, "
543,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," No, we started off bad!  You put an axe in the wall and then stole it, we started off very bad!"
544,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," I lowered my hand back down, [unintelligible]"
545,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Yeah, after he put a guilt trip on ya."
546,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, That’s teamwork sometimes.
547,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Guys, we can agree to disagree, right?"
548,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Fuck off Brad!
549,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
550,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, I think it’s Brent.
551,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You’re onto the third trial.
552,MaxFunCon East Live, Art," Oh, do you know what that trial was supposed to teach you guys?"
553,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Laughs],
554,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," [half laughing] Now, no, but I’m going to guess we didn’t learn it."
555,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Sometimes life throws obstacles at you, sometimes, and it’s easier to get over ‘em with the help from your friends."
556,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Riiight, right, right, ok."
557,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," So you’re onto the third trial, and immediately in front of you is this, a fifteen foot high wall, another one.  A separate fifteen foot high wall that I definitely planned for.  No, fuck it, we gotta do, [Clint laughing] I gotta respect the fiction.  It’s the same wall that you were just standing on that you shrank down, this now two foot high wall.  Off the back of this wall, is a set of now very small stairs leading back down to the ground, but the majority of the backside of this wall is now just a ledge with a two foot drop.  And the loud speaker chirps on, and he goes,"
558,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," This is gonna be kinda anticlimactic, but it’s time for trust falls."
559,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Griffin, audience laughs]",
560,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin laughs loudly],
561,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Ummmm, it’s only two feet, but, "
562,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus falls off it.
563,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] Ok, just,"
564,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Catch me Art!
565,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Ok, the falling style here is like backwards, not looking."
566,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Full on.
567,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [exasperated] So you just fall backwards off the back off the wall.
568,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I trust everyone. 
569,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Ok…
570,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Wait, hold on, give them a chance."
571,MaxFunCon East Live,{33,09}
572,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
573,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who!?
574,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, My friends.
575,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, They’re not-- [sputters] there waiting to catch you! Everybody’s by the wa--
576,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s two feet. They could do it.
577,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh. You fall, but it’s just two feet so you don’t take any damage. But now you’re in catching position for everybody else. [pause] Who’s-- who’s going?"
578,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [sounding extremely done] Me. I fall.
579,MaxFunCon East Live,[Laughter],
580,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, He catches me. We all move on with our lives.
581,MaxFunCon East Live,[Laughter],
582,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Make a strength check.
583,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Fifteen plus eight.
584,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You super catch Taako.
585,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Great job, guys."
586,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I throw him over my shoulder!
587,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Next!
588,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I kinda push Merle out of the way, ‘cause I want to do it."
589,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay!
590,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
591,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," Come on, Brad!"
592,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [under his breath] Oh, dea-- [louder] The ol’ Brad’s got a dark side!"
593,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Now it’s Brad’s time to shine, guys."
594,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, And I arms-wide-open back into Magnus’s arms.
595,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
596,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I move.
597,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience gives loud, surprised “Oooh!”s]",
598,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Do you really?
599,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [to audience] It’s two feet! He’s gonna be fine! [back into mic] I’ve already got Taako over one shoulder.
600,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," No, no. It’s cool. It’s cool. It’s fine."
601,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh. Yeah, Brad, yeah. You fall on your back, Brad. And you don’t take any damage, but it’s embarrassing."
602,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [pained] Oh no!
603,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint cackles],
604,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I’ve been embarrassed before.
605,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah.
606,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," It’s okay, guys. Next time, you know, you’ll catch me next time I fall."
607,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint continues laughing],
608,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," That’s what bein’ friends is all about, Magnus."
609,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, [small] Okay.
610,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Is catching your friends when they fall. And you know, sometimes you slip up."
611,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Suddenly Magnus feels very bad.
612,MaxFunCon East Live,[Laughter],
613,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You, uh, you--"
614,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, As does Travis.
615,MaxFunCon East Live,[Laughter],
616,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You actually fall. When you fall you land on some gum on the floor and it gets in your ponytail.
617,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Noo-oh!
618,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience “no”ing with him],
619,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Uh. I quickly pull some peanut butter out of my pocket that I keep--
620,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You don’t have any items!
621,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Oh no! My magic peanut butter?
622,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," No, it’s just -- it’s just loose peanut butter."
623,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Hey! Listen, Magnus’ll chop your ponytail off for you, if you want."
624,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] Yeah, you’ve got a corrupted body part!"
625,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, He does it all the time!
626,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," That is a… strange use of the word “if I want”. [Clint laughing] Because I do not want that. But sometimes... You know. Sometimes necessity requires sacrifices, guys, and I think this is one of those times--"
627,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, Chop it off.
628,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," So I hold my arm over my eyes, so I don’t have to see my beautiful ponytail --"
629,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [horrified] Oh my god.
630,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," --shorn from my head. And I say,"
631,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Do it, Magnus. I trust you. With your axe near my head."
632,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I just… I just pull his hair out of the gum. It’s not. It’s not, like, a thing. I don’t have to cut it off."
633,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It’s super in there.
634,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," And I want you to look at this. [Audience crows, a yell of “Oh my god!” rings over the sound, appreciative clapping, presumably Clint is gesturing to his arm?] Alright? Look at this. Alright. Make sure you know what’s comin’."
635,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Make an attack roll? On Brad’s hair.
636,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I want you to know. I’m aiming for the very end, where the gum is, so I don’t have to cut off the whole thing."
637,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah. It takes a long-- How long did it take you--
638,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [crosstalk] So lay it on his chest!
639,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Hold on! Wait, before you roll -- some backstory. How long you been workin’ on this ponytail, dog?"
640,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Twenty-five years.
641,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus!
642,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I am aiming for the very last inch that’s stuck in the gum.
643,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay. Go ahead and roll.
644,MaxFunCon East Live,[dice],
645,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [into silence] Oh, god."
646,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It’s a twenty. It’s a crit twenty.
647,MaxFunCon East Live,"[cheers, clapping, Justin shouts “Yeah!”]",
648,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Holy shit! Like a fucking samurai with Hattori Hanzo steel you-- in slow motion you watch each hair be severed and it flows away in the wind. And it leaves you with a lot of ponytail.
649,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Thank you, Magnus. I think it looks better now, actually. You cleared off all my split ends!"
650,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, I feathered it! Anytime.
651,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, Taako, did you trust fall already?"
652,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uh, yeah. Remember...?"
653,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I got ‘em.
654,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, that’s right. Alright. We’re all, we’re all, oh. Merle."
655,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I’m gonna jump over it...
656,MaxFunCon East Live,[Stuart laughs],
657,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Backwards.
658,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience laughing, someone breathing loud.]",
659,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," So, jump. Jump backwards."
660,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, So like a trust jump.
661,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, A trust jump. What do I roll?
662,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, On the ground. You roll on the ground.
663,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," The rule of thumb is, are you flipping? ‘Cause if you’re flipping it’s acrobatics."
664,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Yeah, I flipped."
665,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, what’d you get?"
666,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Uh, fourteen."
667,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, you just jump over Magnus and you land on the floor and you didn’t really trust fall, but it was cool."
668,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," It’s all about how you look, baby."
669,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, [smacks lips] That’s gonna be just one more quick teamwork penalty. [laughter] This is not going great. Anybody wanna just wager a guess at what the trust fall is supposed to teach you?
670,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Falling!
671,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, Trust?
672,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Trust is right! Yes!
673,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, [slyly] Sounds like we should get our penalty back for that.
674,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Nah, it’s still a penalty. You intentionally let a man fall into gum. And then you used an axe on him."
675,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I--! That was good, though."
676,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It was good stuff.
677,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Justin breaks in, singing a melody to transition into the commercial break.]",
678,MaxFunCon East Live,{Commercial Break, 3734- 4258}
679,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, you’re onto the fourth trial. A few feet past the trust fall platform you see a small metal statue on a wooden pedestal and the statue depicts four adventurers an armored dwarven fighter, a devout elven cleric, a bookish human wizard, and a guitar-wielding orc, all laughing and high-fiving each other, obviously a symbol of successful teamwork. From the loudspeaker you hear Art say"
680,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," This is the Totem of Constructive Criticism. [Audience and Clint laugh]  All you have to do to complete this trial is touch the statue and then give someone a piece of helpful advice on their performance, either in this dungeon or just in general. Once all four of you have given some advice you can move on. But don’t be nasty unless you want to get some teamwork penalties."
681,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Laughter],
682,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, So we have to say something nice?
683,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Nope, constructive."
684,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [Exasperated] No, it’s the Totem of Constructive Criticism! [Audience Laughs]"
685,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Okay.
686,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who’s going first?
687,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
688,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Laughter],
689,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, You know I saw we had some cosplay in the audience today-
690,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Who’s going- Okay, we’re actually at about forty five, fifty minutes right now, so-"
691,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Okay, okay, I put my hand on it and I say"
692,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Brad-
693,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, wait, as you touch it. As you touch the statue, one of the four heroes lights up. And the hero that lights up for you, Magnus, is the human wizard. So you have to give a piece of constructive criticism for Taako."
694,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, Yeah go ahead.
695,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Oh dick!
696,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Taako-
697,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, [Drawn out] Yes?
698,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, I feel like…
699,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, [Drawn out] Go on?
700,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Sometimes you cast spells without any consideration of whether or not it might injure me specifically.
701,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Laughs],
702,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," A touch, a palpable touch, I do confess it."
703,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," And I would like it if you would stop doing that, because our cleric sucks at healing."
704,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Laughs],
705,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, that-"
706,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, It’s not about you cleric!
707,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Wait, hold on, wait-"
708,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," That part of the statue turns gold, and he actually turns to give you a thumbs-up."
709,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Nailed it!
710,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who’s next?
711,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Me.
712,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Taako, you touch the statue, and the cleric lights up [Justin Fuck] You need to give a piece of constructive criticism for Merle."
713,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Silence, followed by audience laughter]",
714,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin laughs],
715,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I just want to remind you that this is our Daddy.
716,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," It’s our Da- Hey Justin, it’s our Daddy though."
717,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Yeah, [audience laughs] no no no no no."
718,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, Your spells … can … be used... to heal wounds!
719,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin and Audience laugh],
720,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, So maybe… give ‘er a shot!
721,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
722,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And with that the elven cleric turns gold and gives you a big thumbs-up. Who’s next?
723,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I’ll go.
724,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Merle, you [Merle I’ll go] You touch the statue and the dwarven fighter lights up, and you need to give a constructive criticism for Magnus."
725,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, For your middlest boy. [Griffin For your-] 
726,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [laughing] Wait is Brad gonna have to compliment himself?
727,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
728,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [Also laughing] We’ll see. Constructive criticism for Magnus.
729,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," I think that I would worry a lot less in those times when I’m pondering the fate of you, if maybe you didn’t rush into every situation like a giant horse’s ass."
730,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
731,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Well put.
732,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, like that the dwarven fighter turns gold, gives you a big thumbs-up, and all that’s left is Brad."
733,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, I’ll go next guys.
734,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," Cool, Brad."
735,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, Good choice.
736,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I go up- [Merle Good math] I go up and touch the statue.
737,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, the orc bard lights up and you need to just sort of give yourself, just sort of do a quick sort of-- "
738,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Some self inventory.
739,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah debrief yourself on how it’s been going so far and what you could do better.
740,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You know, Brad, [Clint Laughs]"
741,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I think of Stuart on Saturday Night Live looking in the mirror.
742,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Brad, you know, sometimes you don’t let people get close enough and know the real you."
743,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus.
744,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You hold people at bay, you focus too much on kind of your work relationships and not maybe a relationship outside of work, Brad. You know, they could get to know the Brad that likes to party, you know, that brews his own beer at home and has a stamp collection."
745,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
746,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay yeah, the orc turns gold and gives you a big thumbs-up. [Travis laughs] And Art chimes in and says"
747,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Well it got a little nasty there, but you still managed to get through the thing and so I’m gonna not give you a teamwork penalty on"
748,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Yeah! We solved your stupid puzzle!
749,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," And the advice is- The lessons, good advice makes for good friends. I didn't wanna waste time having you try to guess it."
750,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Okay!
751,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, alright the fifth and final trial. You're standing in front of a large cobblestone wall and again this wall is mostly styrofoam, like a, like a theatrical set. There's uh, a door, a semi-circular door, and a crudely painted sign hanging over the door that marks it as the entrance into The Arena. And you hear Art say,"
752,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," In here, you'll face a deadly opponent. It's up to you to work together, protect each other, and take him down, carefully. Please."
753,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience & Travis laughs],
754,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus rushes in.
755,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You open the door-
756,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," To be fair, I didn't say that, I wanna run right through the door."
757,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You can, yeah, it's- it's essentially, uh, foam."
758,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I wanna leave a Magnus shaped hole in the door.
759,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You just knock the door completely down, uhm, and uh, Art, Arts like,"
760,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Well, people have to use this later- okay, whatever."
761,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And this arena is absolutely clown town. There are some large foam geometric shapes scattered around the arena almost like it's like a laser tag arena. Um, and the whole thing is encircled in this styrofoam wall, and in the middle of this McDonaldLand play place is a large person wearing a costume designed to make them look like a skeletal dragon, but it's really just like a child's skeleton costume from the neck down, like a black sort of suit with bones on it and like a spooky skeleton dragon mask on top, and he goes"
762,MaxFunCon East Live,Skelly, Roar! I'm Skelly the Skeletal Dragon! I can only be beaten by great teamwork!
763,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus sees red.
764,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
765,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] U-uh, he's got a, he's got a bucket, and he starts reaching in and getting these little foam balls out and throwing them at all of you."
766,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Magnus tackles him.
767,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Heh, Actually everyone make a dex save to avoid these, fireballs he's throwing."
768,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [snort-laughs? snickers?] Three.
769,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," What, uh, what am I rolling?"
770,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [unison] A d20-
771,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [unison] A d20, [Clint -a 20.]"
772,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [Referring to Clint’s roll] One!
773,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Oh my god!
774,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I rolled a 19, er a 17 [unintelligible]"
775,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," The joke here was supposed to be that you're just getting hit by little foam balls thrown at you by a man in a skeleton costume, but with a one, I think you actually are gonna take some damage. [Audience laughter] You take nine points of damage from a-"
776,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [yells] WHAT? WAIT-
777,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It hits you in the- it hits you in the throat.
778,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Did it have railroad spikes stickin' out of it?
779,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It hits you in the throat and you get the wind knocked out of you and you take nine points of damage. [Travis Wow]
780,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Shiit. 
781,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," You know that wind [Clint Shoot, shoot.] doesn't live in your throat, right?"
782,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Huh? [Audience laughter]
783,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You get hit in the throat and the wind- doesn't matter.
784,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Do you [Clint] need me to keep track of your health or you need help with your iPad?
785,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Let him have his fun… No, I got it."
786,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, and uh, so you have this skeleton man throwing- Did you- Everybody, oh- Taako, you got hit by styrofoam balls, but it's fine. [crosstalk]"
787,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I- I rolled a 19.
788,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, you fuckin', [makes whooshing noises] It's awesome."
789,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Are you Matrix-ing over there?
790,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah- yeah that was supposed to be Matrix-ing. Uh, what do you do?"
791,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, So what d'you guys think we should do?
792,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, This conversations happening-
793,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, [Wheezing]
794,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughing],
795,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," Okay, th- thank you."
796,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, I- Maybe we should throw the balls... back at him?
797,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," Oh, I like that. "
798,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
799,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I pick up a ball and throw it at the... skel-skelly.
800,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, alright, do a ranged attack throw and add-"
801,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [yikes-laughter] First one of those bad boys. Let's see how this goes Not great. Uh, ten?"
802,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, no you don't hit him with a ten."
803,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Okay, I try it."
804,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, you pick up a ball."
805,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's a... two?
806,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Jesus, guys! The wheels are falling off this-"
807,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's hard to throw foam balls!
808,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," What'd you roll, Ben?"
809,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I rolled a two... [Audience laughter]
810,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus. 
811,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Eighteen! [Audience cheering, clapping] YES!"
812,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright you throw a- you throw a foam ball at him and you hit him in the throat. And you hear him go [Skelly [gurgly-choking noises]] and he falls down to the floor. And you have- [Merle Suck it, Skelly!] And you have conquered Skelly the Skeletal Dragon. "
813,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle, You're welcome.
814,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I cast Healing Word on the skeleton.
815,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Awww.
816,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Hey you- you did a really good job, Guy, don't worry about your throat. You heal, six damage."
817,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, he stands up and says [Skelly Aw, man, thanks!] And he starts throwing foam balls at all of you again."
818,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
819,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Guys, sometimes thems [Magnus Brad-] the breaks, you know."
820,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I cast Enhance Ability on Skelly the Skeleton.
821,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, [Audience laughter][Travis I punch Merle in the-] He starts throwing the balls at you much harder."
822,MaxFunCon East Live,Skelly," Aw, man, I feel fucking awesome!"
823,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter throughout],
824,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, He's not throwing at me!
825,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [Makes Matrix noises]
826,MaxFunCon East Live,Skelly, This fuckin' rules! Yeah! The power is unbelievable!
827,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
828,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I still have my shield, right?"
829,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, yeah. Alright, you block with the shield."
830,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I'm getting hit by balls.
831,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You're just getting hit by balls. Anybody wanna take initiative here?
832,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I swing... Railsplitter at the guy in a costume?
833,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience ooh-ing],
834,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, What?
835,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay-
836,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Let's- [Crosstalk]
837,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, [Crosstalk] Oh my god.
838,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [Crosstalk] Yeah, no, roll a d20!"
839,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Non- Non-lethal damage.
840,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Can you specify that?
841,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's a 19.
842,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Oh no!
843,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Plus 9, that's a 28."
844,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, So he non-lethally hits him for 28.
845,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," No, n- no that's not the damage."
846,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah roll [laughing] damage.
847,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Yeah roll damage. Roll damage on this guy in a costume.
848,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience & Justin laughing],
849,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Who's a co worker.
850,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [Laughing] Wait, okay wait, I need you to justify this from a character perspective. Why are you hitting a man with an axe? [Griffin laughing] They have a word for that and it's murderer."
851,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," To be fair, he's throwing shit at us. I'm hitting him with the blunt side."
852,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, okay that works."
853,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh yeah, that won't hurt him."
854,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's 11 damage.
855,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, uh, where do you hit him?"
856,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, In the nards.
857,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [Strained] On the noggin.
858,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, On the noggin? Okay- 
859,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Woah, yeah, the- the soft spot."
860,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [Laughs] He f-
861,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Listen, you're not asking Travis, you're asking Magnus."
862,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," He falls to the ground like a sack of bricks. Uh, and you hear him go like"
863,MaxFunCon East Live,Skelly," [Weakly] O-oh no... no, no, no, no, noo..."
864,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I start prepping another healing word.
865,MaxFunCon East Live,Skelly, I'm so proud of... your teamwork...
866,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
867,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, and with that you've beaten the fifth trial! And, uh, behind you, behind the dragon, I should say, another sort of fake, set, portcullis opens up, which opens up into a staircase leading up to the final chamber! Uh, and you come to a small room with a large wooden treasure chest with a bright light shining down from on top of it, but again you can kinda tell it's like a prop treasure chest, uh, that you might get at a Fantasy Target, or something, to decorate a dorm room, maybe? Uh, and yeah that's all that's in this room is this treasure chest."
868,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, This sucks!
869,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's Magnus.
870,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
871,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Okay. 
872,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Was that a character voice?
873,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Yeah,"
874,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, You gonna open the chest?
875,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I open the chest.
876,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," I think we should open it all together, guys."
877,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
878,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako, Yeah that's great.
879,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, All four of you all at the same time- Are you on twitter over there Taako?
880,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," No, I was opening some Pringles."
881,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You, uh, you open up the chest and a spring loaded scroll pops out and unfurls, and the word ""friendship"" is written on the scroll. [Audience laughter] And a spurt of confetti comes out of the chest."
882,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Magnus, Magnus d'you wanna read the scroll for everybody?"
883,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," ...It says friendship, Brad."
884,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Kinda makes you think, right?"
885,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You hear, uh- "
886,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter & applause],
887,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You hear Art's voice say, um"
888,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, You guys don't seem like you're having a great time in there. Can I ask what the problem is?
889,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," It’s not... good test, I'm sorry Art."
890,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," You don't seem like the Trial of Teamwork is like, engaging you really and teaching you lessons about- "
891,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, We've done a lot of shit together that was like way worse than this. 
892,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Oh, this is too easy?"
893,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," Yeah,"
894,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Well, why didn't you say so."
895,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, Oh no.
896,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, The ground beneath you-
897,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Ooooooh god. [Audience laughter]
898,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," -disappears. And all four of you somehow fall perfectly into a hole positioned, directly underneath you, and you're going down a long spiralling slide, a fully enclosed tube like a waterslide, and after, uh, a minute or so of sliding all four of you pop out of holes in the wall of a new room. It's roughly the size of the one that you were just in, but there's something different about it? The make of this room feels more authentic, like an actual dungeon, uh, you've been in dungeons before, this one feels more real and less like a set-"
899,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Wait, you guys have been in dungeons before?"
900,MaxFunCon East Live,Merle," Aw, yeah."
901,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," We'll tell you about it when you're older, Brad."
902,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, I actually- Y'know what, I say that? This may be our first dungeon and that was our first dragon. We've done it."
903,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, We've never been in a dungeon.
904,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, it has the familiar sulfur-y, dungeon-y smell, uh, you're- you notice some other things."
905,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Yeah you get some some bleach in there, you can take that right out."
906,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You notice some other weird things. Brad, you don't notice anything in, in peculiar. Taako, you're standing up, but you feel like your vantage point is lower to the ground than usual. And Merle, the inverse is true for you, you're taller than you've ever been. And Magnus, you see Merle, and you see Brad, and you see yourself. I'm gonna need you guys to trade character sheets."
907,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
908,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Taako, you realize you are now Merle Highchurch, the Dwarven Cleric. Uh, Merle, you are now Magnus Burnsides, Human Fighter. [Travis It’s magic!]  And, Magnus you are now Taako, the Elven Wizard."
909,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," ...Should we trade costumes, too?"
910,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs],
911,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I'll use any excuse to strip.
912,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I'm gonna- That's true, that's how I got through college. Can I get those cards, please? I'll tell you about it when you're older."
913,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I'm not gonna get any older.
914,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Are you gonna die today?
915,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Does everybody have their new character sheets? This is why I said to have all of your character sheets good and ready because other people are going to be using them. Are we all good to go?
916,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Yes...
917,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I'm doing great.
918,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, Brad, you're still just Brad, still Brad-ding it up"
919,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Yeah just Brad-ding it out.
920,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I'm not wearing the hand but you can- I'm not wearing the hand but you can take it off if you want.
921,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," How, uh, how do you all respond to b- So uh- I wanna make it clear- "
922,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [unintelligible] I immediately fire off a spell.
923,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, what d'you- What do you cast?"
924,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I don't know. [Crosstalk] Dominate Person.
925,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [Crosstalk] Hey d'you wanna- Well I wanna ask-
926,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It was the first spell on the top of the pile.
927,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, who do you cast it on?"
928,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, ...Brad.
929,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
930,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, because you've never cast magic before in your brain, you do have a magical body and this magical staff, you manage to cast it. It doesn't last very long, but you do definitely control the mind of Brad for like 2 seconds, uhh, and Brad that's not a good feeling I don't think."
931,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Make him cuss, make him say something really dirty."
932,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," He says ""fart."""
933,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, Fart.
934,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Alright.
935,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
936,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," I figured that this would be about 5 minutes of the show, does anyone else have anything they wanna do with anybody's bodies."
937,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Hey- D'you wanna wear my hair?
938,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Yeah. D'you wanna wear mine?
939,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, Taako, uh, or I should say Merle, how do you respond to being out of the Taako body and into the Merle body, Justin."
940,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uhh, what am I?"
941,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin,  You're Merle.
942,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [Taako voice] ""UUGH-"" Wait, do I have a character voice?"
943,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, I think so- [crosstalk]"
944,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [crosstalk] Sometimes- 
945,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [crosstalk] Don't use it, though."
946,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [crosstalk] Same character voice, coming out of different bodies."
947,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin as Merle]," [Proper voice] UUGH, I can't believe I'm so short, I hate this! [Audience laughs] Oh by the way, I look amazing. Look at my hair and my cool pointy hat! I never really appreciated how beautiful I was when I was in my body, and now that I'm in this misshapen lump, this aberration, this body that God forgot, [Griffin & Audience laugh] this sin, this living sin against aesthetics, [Griffin & Justin laugh] that is- that is Merle Highchurch, I- I really appreciate me so much more. "
948,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh,"
949,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I am so changing my will.
950,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's not my voice.
951,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah Magnus how do you, er- Dad, how do you, Merle, like being in Magnus' form?"
952,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence] ,
953,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Alright.
954,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, What is your voice?
955,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It's like a gruff boy.
956,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's manly and gravely and gruff.
957,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Um, uh, [laughs] oh no, I can't- yeah, uhm. [Magnus voice] I look down, and I guess I've been swimming."
958,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Aw man, he did a wiener joke on you!"
959,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
960,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's not- Listen- 
961,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Did you hear all the shit he said about me!
962,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Listen, I'm just gonna say, that's non-canonical."
963,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Magnus, "
964,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [Taako voice] Well, I will say one- [voice falters] one-"
965,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's not your voice.
966,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Hey Justin, use your fucking character voice, dog."
967,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Yeah! Get your character voice! Get your shit together!
968,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs and cheers],
969,MaxFunCon East Live,[Travis as Taako], Use your character voice!
970,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Oh, that's better, that's more like-"
971,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," I'm putting these Pringle calories in your body, but I'm getting all the Pringle eating satisfaction myself! It's the grandest illusion of them all."
972,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And, uh, Magnus, I imagine you enjoy your magical capabilities, it's all you, really."
973,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, I'm having a great time!
974,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, uh, let's move on to the first trial of this new trial chamber. You step in and it looks familiar, except again like, it looks real- it looks like a real dungeon. And it's um, it's kinda warm in here and it doesn't take you long to realize what the source of that heat is. Immediately in front of you is the balance beam trial you navigated earlier, five six and a half foot long planks of wood resting on metal poles that form a thirty long-- foot long zig-zag path, but there's no red carpet behind this-- underneath this path. Instead, there's a shallow trench, filled with glowing, steaming, molten rock. The floor is actually, literally lava."
975,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Magnus rushes in.
976,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering & clapping],
977,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, As- as he's rushing in I cast Enhance Ability-
978,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, shit."
979,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," -on that Magnus. Uh, I'm giving him Cat's Grace."
980,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay. I think that's +2 to acrobatics, so go ahead and roll, roll your roll. Are you just running across the whole span of the bridge?"
981,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Yes!
982,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
983,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, ...which one?
984,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, The twenty-- one with the number tonty on it.
985,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Wow, it really-- Nineteen! [Audience cheering]"
986,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you-"
987,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Plus! Plus, some other stuff..."
988,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," A shit-ton, yeah. You soar across the bridge, you easily make it across to the other side, of the gap."
989,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Yeah I think Dad is well prepared to navigate someone else's character sheet. [Stuart laughs]
990,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah.
991,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint as Magnus], I'm Magnus!
992,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
993,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [crosstalk] You have a-
994,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [crosstalk] That is my classic catchphrase.
995,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [crosstalk] -you have a catchphrase, yeah."
996,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus, Magnus rules!
997,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Uh what's everybody else- what's everybody else doin'?
998,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I'm gonna cast Levitate- 
999,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Oh a- aw you- you're stealin'
1000,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, -on Merle's body.
1001,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Ohh, okay. So that's T-t-Justin. Okay, Justin, uh, you, Merle, are now floating in the air!"
1002,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," And, push him over the thing."
1003,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright,"
1004,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, Wheeeee.
1005,MaxFunCon East Live,[Stuart & Audience laughing],
1006,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, that just leaves you, Taako, and Brad."
1007,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, And I'm gonna cast Phantom Steed-
1008,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, shit!"
1009,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering & Clint laughing],
1010,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No, wait! Don't clap yet! How is a horse gonna help you, phantom or not, how is a horse gonna help you do this?!"
1011,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl, Yooo.
1012,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, suddenly right in front of you is this spectral stee-"
1013,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," I need you now more than ever, Garyl!"
1014,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," Th- First off, I'm not fooled. Second, I know that's you. Second, this seems like a misuse of my skills."
1015,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1016,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl, Did you know h-
1017,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, We're gonna jump in together!
1018,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You're jumping--
1019,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," You know horses, are kind of a distance thing. This is a small room."
1020,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," So, you're gonna make Garyl jump 30 feet-?"
1021,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I'm just so excited to have magic.
1022,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, O-kay. You mount up on Garyl's spectral back and- What are you doing? You jum- you jumping?
1023,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Should you mention- I mean I should clarify if you haven't listened before. Garyl is the world's most beautiful binicorn, he's a unicorn with two horns and they're both rainbows and he's fuckin’- the best character in the whole thing."
1024,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," So what's up, what we doin'?"
1025,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, let's poop or get off the pot here, Trav."
1026,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Uh, I'm gonna cast Reduce on Garyl, and put him in my pocket."
1027,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin & Audience laughing],
1028,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, tiny Garyl, what's that sound like?"
1029,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," Yeah, fine."
1030,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," You're coming with me, Garyl!"
1031,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, And I run across the boards!
1032,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] Okay, make a fucking acrobatics roll, you've just wasted so much time!"
1033,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [rolls] ...that's a four!
1034,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience Ooh-ing],
1035,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Plus three,"
1036,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," That's not- that is not adequate. Uh, you fall, make a-"
1037,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Hey, that's my body, be careful, idiot!"
1038,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You make a dex save for me as you teeter off- you make it about halfway off the bridge and you lose your balance and go off the right side.
1039,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," That's a twenty, he rolled."
1040,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," That's a seventeen,"
1041,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, you manage to catch yourself off the edge on the thing, you are now hanging off of the balance beam bridge, uh-"
1042,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one Garyl!
1043,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl, Well that's- that's a real shame for you 'cause I'm a my little pony now. [Audience laughing] And you know how this shakes out.
1044,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Y'know, you guys are working so much better this time. What's going on?"
1045,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, He's dangling over a pit of lava.
1046,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] Yeah, he's really dangling over lava."
1047,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I start walking over the bridge,"
1048,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
1049,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Hey, you need a hand there buddy?"
1050,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, I do!
1051,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I reach down to give him a hand.
1052,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Make a-
1053,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I use the Umbra Staff to do Feather Fall on myself.
1054,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Into the lava?
1055,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, You're gonna fall into the lava!
1056,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," No no no, it makes me really light so he can pick me up."
1057,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, I think it makes him lighter. Alright, so roll a, uh, ac- what would be lift-? I guess a strength check with advantage, 'cause you're also kinda keeping your balance?"
1058,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, [Breathes in] Not really good at that.
1059,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Well, you have advantage so you can roll 2 'cause he's made himself very, very light. [Stuart rolls] Oh boy."
1060,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Sixteen.
1061,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, yeah, you get him back up onto the bridge and then the- all of you have crossed the bridge to the other side. You just got your life saved by Brad."
1062,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I pat him on the butt.
1063,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
1064,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering & applause],
1065,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Brad files a report on himself.
1066,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Inappropriate touching.
1067,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, We're at trial two. Uh-
1068,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," You've earned this tiny horse, Brad!"
1069,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, You give Garyl to Brad?
1070,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I did.
1071,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Alright.
1072,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I take Garyl, I say"
1073,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Hey Garyl, it's great to meet you, I'm a huge fan. I've heard all about you."
1074,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Oh Garyl’s not gonna put up with that shit. [Silence]...I guess he is-
1075,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," Yo, yeah, that's cool, it's so good to meet you too."
1076,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Can I get a picture with you after this? I know it's a little weird, but-"
1077,MaxFunCon East Live,Garyl," I only last an hour, my dude. Let's see how quickly these dipshits pull through."
1078,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you are standing in front of another fifteen foot high wall, uh, this one is metal, not wood, and, uh, it's- it's not totally smooth, though. It's got these small circular cutouts that are just shallow enough to get kind of a finger hold in. Um, so it's gonna be tricky to climb up this thing, but it's doable, but in front of the wall are two small crates and sitting on top of each one is a strange apparatus that looks like two belts attached by a ten foot long cord, uh, and they look like a pair of belt handcuffs essentially and there's two of these, uh, and, uh, there's one pair of these tethered belts on each box, and you hear Art say"
1079,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Before attempting that wall, you need to choose a partner. Choose wisely because this is not a trial where you wanna work with dead weight!"
1080,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I jump forward, and look at you all expectantly."
1081,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Oh my god.
1082,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, I think Brad should go with Taako. He seems like the only competent one of the four of us.
1083,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, I guess it's just you and me Magnus.
1084,MaxFunCon East Live,[pause],
1085,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Wait-
1086,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Wait, this is getting very confusing."
1087,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Wait this is getting so fucking confusing.
1088,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, So you are teaming up with Taako's body?
1089,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I- wait- maybe? No, I was teaming up with Magnus' body."
1090,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, you're teaming up with Magnus' body, [crosstalk] that has Merle in it."
1091,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [crosstalk] No- I- Brad-
1092,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Holy shit. Start over, who's teaming up with who in this?"
1093,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Okay, Ma- Merle-body said Taako-body should go with Brad-Brad,"
1094,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Oooh.
1095,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, 'Cause Brad- 'cause Merle-
1096,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Two people raise your hands right now! That's one, that's two. We got it, there it is. [Audience cheering] Taako and Brad are Team #1. Uh, you all strap on these belts and you are tethered by a ten foot long cord. What are you- let's get up that wall."
1097,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Cool. I cast-
1098,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," I cast Animate Objects, and I animate the wall!"
1099,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, To do what?
1100,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, To carry us up!
1101,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, ...Oh god.
1102,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter & Travis chuckling],
1103,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, It's very Roger Rabbit.
1104,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, no, let's do this because we've gone so long. Uh, gross, metal hands like that one super creepy scene in The Labyrinth, [Travis Yup] just kinda like-"
1105,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1106,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [goofy voice] Do you guys wanna ride?
1107,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you ride up and-"
1108,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," It's really comfortable, guys!"
1109,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," The two of you have made it on top of the wall and as soon as you get to the top, your belts fall off and you are untethered and you have cleared the trial. Uh, Merle and Magnus- "
1110,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1111,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I grab- [Loudly] I grab-!
1112,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [crosstalk] No, no, nope, no, no."
1113,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [crosstalk] He's not louder-
1114,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [crosstalk] He doesn't just yell all the time.
1115,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, No you wouldn't- if you wouldn't [crosstalk]
1116,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [crosstalk] Got it- to go a little raspy-?
1117,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Like, okay, let me show- lemme give you an example. 'I pat my Dad on the shoulder.' Like, I don't have to do that, I just patted you on the shoulder. So like you can just say that normally."
1118,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Okay so when I talk about what I'm doing I can just do it- I can just do it normal.
1119,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Right, you just do it normal."
1120,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," What are you guys gonna do to get over this wall, by the way?"
1121,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [Merle voice] Okay, I, uh.."
1122,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, What the fuck.
1123,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Now you do that voice.
1124,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Die a thousand deaths.
1125,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," I rush over and I grab Merle's short, but really well sculpted body."
1126,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
1127,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] Sure,"
1128,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, And I notice he's been workin' out-
1129,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Excellent, excellent, excellent."
1130,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, And I throw that lil' pecker right over the wall
1131,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Are you putting on the belt?
1132,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, Wheeee.
1133,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Are you putting on the be-
1134,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Yes!
1135,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, you have the belts on, and you throw him up, ten feet, and then the cord snaps and it pulls you forward and the you smash into the wall and then he falls ten feet. And both of you take, 7 points of damage."
1136,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1137,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," ...But it was funny, right?"
1138,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," It was super fucking funny,"
1139,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," It wa- It was pretty funny, if you admit it."
1140,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Yeah, le- let's call that one a rough draft, guys."
1141,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin & Audience laughing],
1142,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Okay, uh, lemme try-"
1143,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," So I'm dead now, right?"
1144,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No, you're not dead."
1145,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You're in my body.
1146,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh Magnus-! Oh, okay."
1147,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I have a lot of hit points.
1148,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Okay, smartass, what're you gonna do?"
1149,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uhm, I'm gonna turn around to the wall,"
1150,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah,"
1151,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, And I'm gonna cast Flame Strike on the wall.
1152,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Shit, okay."
1153,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Yeah. ""A vertical column of divine fire roars"" [starts to laugh] ""from the heavens in a location that's specified."""
1154,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Guys, they're standing on top of the fucking wall!"
1155,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
1156,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Wait, we are trying to get to the top, aren't we? Let me try again."
1157,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No, I mean, you gotta do it now."
1158,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I don't have to do anyth- Okay I f- fire the ceiling, I'm like"
1159,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Hurhur, good job guys, let me try another spell."
1160,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," And I pro- I hope Art's office is directly above us, and just a column of divine flame just shot through his floor."
1161,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1162,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Do I really have a spell like that?
1163,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing and cheering],
1164,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Alright, I'm gonna summon the one person that can help us."
1165,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Aw, good. "
1166,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Della Reese.
1167,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Della Reese.
1168,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, [Audience cheering] I'm gonna- I'm gonna get through this quickly. You summon a guardian angel that looks like Della Reese and she gives you a comforting hug and then- I think, grabs you by the tethering cord?"
1169,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," That's a thing, and it picks us up."
1170,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, like- well, like, she picks you up by the tethering cord so you two kind of slap together like nunchucks or something."
1171,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Like those knockers you get at Myrtle Beach.
1172,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Like truck nuts.
1173,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs],
1174,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Like truck nuts, yeah. She turns you into living truck nuts and deposits you and she says, uh,"
1175,MaxFunCon East Live,Della Reese, That was a waste of my time.
1176,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And disappears!
1177,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1178,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, We've been touched by an angel.
1179,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, We've been burned by an angel.
1180,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Heh, yeah, uhh, and, uh, you're onto the fourth challenge, uh, right? Oh, no the third challenge- "
1181,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Guys, guys we haven't accrued any Teamwork Penalties this time."
1182,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, We're doin' great.
1183,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah you’re doing a good job.
1184,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," And, except, maybe we killed Art earlier, so there may not be anybody left. Travis hit 'im with an axe, but not in the way you think."
1185,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, yeah, okay, the third- the third trial is trust falls. Only this time it's not a shrunk down wall, it is a fifteen foot wall, uh, and, uh, Art says"
1186,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Let's do it right this time, maybe, please? Do it right this time? Do this one right this time and don't make it little and like, a joke, I worked really hard on this."
1187,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
1188,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Um, can I do an investigate check to look for gum on the floor?"
1189,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
1190,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience & Clint laughs],
1191,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," [crosstalk] Oh, I totally see it."
1192,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [crosstalk] He's just got so much hair.
1193,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," He actually says, this'll be fun, he sa-"
1194,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Twenty-two.
1195,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, no gum. He says, uh,"
1196,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Actually we need to start out with a designated catcher. I don't want any of you guys to fall a bunch of feet so, Brad why don't you actually head down, uh, go down those stairs on the back of the wall and you can be the first catcher, how's that sound?"
1197,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," That sounds great, I'd love that."
1198,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, you go down those stairs and you are standing at the bottom of the wall, ready to catch a person."
1199,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I have my arms out and say
1200,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You can do it, Taako."
1201,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's me.
1202,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
1203,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I- 
1204,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, I fall!
1205,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, so as Taako, uh, puts his back to the ledge and starts to fall backwards, right as he starts to fall backwards, you see a hatch open up in the back of the wall, and it reveals this pedestal with a beautiful, shining ruby on it. And it's right there, right in front of you, as Taako falls through the air."
1206,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Wait a- a ruby for me?
1207,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Just a beautiful ruby, directly in front of you that opens up like a little prize hatch."
1208,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," That's really tempting, I love rubies."
1209,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Yeah, get the ruby. "
1210,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I forgot to mention that about Brad, Brad is crazy for rubies. "
1211,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Well he's a winter, and they look good with his complexion. "
1212,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Thank you!
1213,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I feel like Taako definitely cast Feather Fall with the Umbra Staff.
1214,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, no no no no no, we're not retconnin' that."
1215,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I definitely did, didn't you?"
1216,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Brad, what do you do, do you keep your positsh'?"
1217,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I keep my position, and I start humming Arms Wide Open under my breath."
1218,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Clint & Griffin laughing, Audience clapping]",
1219,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, And when I land in his arms I say
1220,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Hello my friend, we meet again. It's been a while."
1221,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I res- I resist the urge to give him a little friendly kiss on the cheek.
1222,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," You can do it if you want to, I don't mind."
1223,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, It's against regulations for HR.
1224,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs] ,
1225,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, Okay.
1226,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," I- I'm gonna say because you sang a bar of a Creed song, you used your bardly powers to empower yourself and catch him easily and not have to make a roll for that one. Uh, who's doing next? "
1227,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, Me. I jump off. 
1228,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Y'know, uh, not for nothin' but his spell cards are largely useless."
1229,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [Laughing] Okay,"
1230,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Thank you!
1231,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Like, I- I tried to look for one, they're not very good."
1232,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Yes, thank you very much!"
1233,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," No, unless you need to heal people. I mean, you could deffo- you could deffo do that, for sure, like a ton."
1234,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, okay-"
1235,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Well, I haven't seen you heal anybody!"
1236,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [whispering] Nobody's gotten hurt yet, Clinton."
1237,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, We've been gettin' hurt all over the place!
1238,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," We've gotta- we've gotta pick up the pace just a little bit, we're almost done."
1239,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," So I fell, so I fell [fart noise]"
1240,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, uh, you fall off the back of the platform, same thing happens, Merle- uh, um- Taako, only this time you see it, the hatch in the wall opens up and and uh, uh, there's a beautiful, shining gemstone inside of it."
1241,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Grab it! Grab the gemstone, Taako, you can do it! I'll be fine, my body's made of rubber."
1242,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, He can always- he can always heal himself.
1243,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, But the thing is- 
1244,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, I can!
1245,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," This is interesting 'cause I feel like, the Taako body instinctively reaches for it? [Griffin laughs] But like the Magnus mind is like 'I don't care?' and, um, uh, so do I need to do like a battle with my own body?"
1246,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, [crosstalk] I think, I think-"
1247,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," [crosstalk] Yeah, what does he roll to battle his own body?"
1248,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, I think you can just say whether or not you do it.
1249,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Nah.
1250,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, yeah, you stand in place and you catch- you catch... Merle as he falls off the wall, and Magnus you're the only one still at the top, what d'you do?"
1251,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," I, uh, I fall,"
1252,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1253,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," But as I fall, in really cool, action movie style-"
1254,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You're just supposed to fall backwards, it's a fucking trust fall."
1255,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I- I flipped before. You let me flip before.
1256,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, you're right, you did it bad though, and you got a teamwork penalty."
1257,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Well, I was gonna stick a dagger in the wall and let it slow me down."
1258,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," OKAY, COOL."
1259,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's a metal wall!
1260,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, It's your body! You do shit like that all the time!
1261,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You're right.
1262,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay make an- make an attack roll on the wall then.
1263,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, It's a great body.
1264,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Oh, wait, am I catching him?"
1265,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, not now."
1266,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
1267,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Okay, I- I cast Zone of Truth on myself. [Clint laughs]"
1268,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, You're fucked!
1269,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughs],
1270,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, But I do thank you for using Zone of Truth. Zone of Truth is a copyrighted feature.
1271,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Of Dungeons and Dragons. Of Wizards of the Coast LLC.
1272,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, A subsidiary of...
1273,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I rolled- I rolled a two...
1274,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay. Ping! Like, your dagger just bounces off of it, and you fall, and you're way out of position to be caught, and-"
1275,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I pop him with- with Feather Fall.
1276,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, okay, you hit him with Feather Fall, uh, and this gives you- uh, the three of you a longer than normal window, you see this hatch open up and there's a beautiful, shining red ruby inside."
1277,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, You know I grab-
1278,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Don't fucking touch it, Taako!"
1279,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [laughs] You're gonna have to stop me. I reach in and grab the-
1280,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," No, I'm gonna use Dominate Person."
1281,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Okay,"
1282,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1283,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Jesus.
1284,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, He must succeed a wisdom saving throw.
1285,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, make a wisdom saving throw, uhh, Merle."
1286,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Nat 20, fuck you!"
1287,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Fuck!
1288,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1289,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, NOTHING STOPS ME FROM GETTING RUBIES THAT I DESIRE.
1290,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, Merle you reach in and grab this ruby and nothing happens, you just have this beautiful ruby, [crosstalk] and it's worth a thousand gold pieces."
1291,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, [crosstalk] Hell yeah! It always pays!
1292,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," It's one thousand gold pieces and I guess, Merle has it?"
1293,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," That's right, stick it in Merle's bag!"
1294,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I go over and put it in Taako's bag, [Clint Why!?] and then- wait, is Zone of Truth still effective-?"
1295,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1296,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Okay
1297,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," That was awesome, I don't regret anything!"
1298,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1299,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you fall to the floor, Magnus, but you had Feather Fall on so you- it was fairly harmless. Uh, fourth trial, we're almost done guys I promise."
1300,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I take my bag and I give it t- to... Merle...
1301,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," J-Jesus. Uh, okay,"
1302,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," I'm not gonna take it, 'cause you're trying to give it to me from my body. Wait-?"
1303,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Moving on.
1304,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Aw man, we can't get stuck in the weeds again. I don't wanna have to re- reboot you a third time."
1305,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I give it to Barney.
1306,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, You make it to the fourth trial, [Audience laughing] You guys make it to the fourth trial which is the Totem of Constructive Criticism, and in place of all four of these heroes, are four fucking skeletons, and here's why. Not a single one of you followed the constructive criticism that you offered the person whose body you currently inhabit, from the first round of trials."
1307,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience & Clint Ooohing],
1308,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh, it's like a twist."
1309,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Taako you were casting spells like fucking crazy, Merle you didn't heal anybody, Magnus you literally rushed into the first trial, Brad you didn't tell us-"
1310,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Okay, now wait now wait now hold on-on-on-on, I did Enhance his abilities, which is like pre-healing, to save myself from healing him later."
1311,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, That's a good point.
1312,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, my dude."
1313,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, Audience- Audience poll, who thinks that M-Merle passed his own constructive criticism?"
1314,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1315,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And who thinks he failed? 
1316,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Aw f-
1317,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering louder & Clint laughing],
1318,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Suck my dick, seriously. [Griffin laughing] Fuckin' a-hole- [mockingly] 'I love The Adventure Zone!' [normally] Do you? I'm not so sure."
1319,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uhh, and Brad you didn't tell us anything more about yourself, really."
1320,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, He loves rubies!
1321,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," No, other than- than I love fucking rubies, dude."
1322,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Yeah, we learned that!"
1323,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, al- all four of you take 19 points of necrotic damage [Justin laughing] as black energy pours out of the statue and sort of encompasses your body."
1324,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Y'know, I deserve that, actually."
1325,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1326,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, we are on to the final trial, and you are standing in front of the entrance [Stuart [quietly] I don't know where it went..] to a-- Do you not have a pen? Here, here."
1327,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," It's okay, It's not my character sheet anyways."
1328,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you're standing in front of the entrance to the arena again, only it's very real this time, it's not paper-mâché walls, it is a real, scary looking, cobblestone arena. There's blood splashes on the wall, there's some skeletons chained up by the entrance, uhh, it's- it's a pretty scary scene-"
1329,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Are they- are they dead skeletons or are they like, wiggling around? "
1330,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1331,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No, these are dead skeletons."
1332,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That's a fair question!
1333,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1334,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, No these are dead- these are the skeletons of the dead variety.
1335,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Thank you.
1336,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I say
1337,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Guys, guys, guys, let's huddle up real quick. [(T) Taako Okay,] I think we can do this one, we've been doing great so far, uh, Magnus, Taako-"
1338,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, What podcast are you listening to?
1339,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Y'know what, here's- wait, nope, that's not my voice..."
1340,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," No matter matter how many times we get knocked down, we pick ourselves back up. Y'know what you guys all get? A dice of Bardic Inspiration."
1341,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Cool!
1342,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, So take one eight sided die and you get to roll it sometime when you need an extra eight sided die to add to something.
1343,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Okay, fantastic."
1344,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I'm gonna- I'm gonna switch to bard.
1345,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, Fantastic.
1346,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," It's called using the rules, guys."
1347,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Um, here's what I'm gonna do, [Griffin Okay] I'm gonna work with my team, because I don't know what the shit any of my spells do. So Taako, you tell me what spells to use when."
1348,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [Laughing] That's good.
1349,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," [Using the wrong voice] Okay. You already got Garyl, right?"
1350,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Wait- who are you?
1351,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Wait- [combining the voices] I'm a hybrid.
1352,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin & Audience laughing],
1353,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, He is the Daywalker!
1354,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," I'm a terrible Island of Doctor Moreau style abomination. Uhm. I can't play, two characters at once. [Griffin laughing] I mean admittedly it would still be better than Dad, but-"
1355,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1356,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I had nothing to do with this conversation!
1357,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Listen guys, we don't do a lot well, but the one thing we do dell- do do well, I think we can do well here. And that's beat ass. Let's beat some ass!"
1358,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, And I cast Mass Cure Wounds.
1359,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, okay! Everybody-"
1360,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I had that spell?
1361,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Fuck you.
1362,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1363,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Let's just say everybody's healed back up to full so we don't waste time rolling.
1364,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Hell yeah.
1365,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Yeah, that's some good DM-ing."
1366,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, it is when you have- four minutes. Um, now we have a little bit- We started late, we can go a little bit later than, what, six... six? "
1367,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Just keep going.
1368,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Dinner's at six-thirty, we're good, okay. Uh, you charge into the battle after that cool catchphrase that I completely stepped on by checking on time for a minute there, uh, and you are in the arena, only it is not clowntown this time. It is, uh, pitch black, the door shuts behind you and this time you can't seem to get it open, and the sconces on the wall burst into bright, green flame, which illuminate the arena and you see you're standing on a big pile of bones, that make it kinda tricky to walk around. Twenty feet, or so, in front of you, a massive ribcage emerges from the bone pile, and then two big skeletal wings, and then two large claws forming the shape of a real skeletal dragon, only it doesn't have a head, there's no head on it. You hear Art chime in and say, uh"
1369,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," Now, uh, let's tally up those teamwork penalties."
1370,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And then suddenly three skulls attached to three long, bony necks emerge, sort of flanking, uh, the body of this skeletal dragon. One for each teamwork penalty you're incurred so far."
1371,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, Go get 'em Brad!
1372,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And, uh, all three heads, uh, roar, ready for battle and, with your permission, I think let's not do initiative, let's just- one of you guys take an action and then I'll take an action and we'll just go back and forth."
1373,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Freeform.
1374,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Freeform, baby, jazz."
1375,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uh, okay, as requested, Trav, here's the spell you should cast on Taako's body-"
1376,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Do this in character- No you gotta do this in character, you're yelling, as Merle, to Taako."
1377,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Got it.
1378,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Taako, quick, cast this on yourself!"
1379,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, I cast Greater Invisibility on myself.
1380,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing & cheering],
1381,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1382,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle, Excellent.
1383,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Taako, poof!, vanishes."
1384,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I think you have Feign Death in there...
1385,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Um, that means I have an attack, now. Uh, the, uh, body of the-"
1386,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Wait hold on, that was just an action. And then I run underneath the dragon, invisible."
1387,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, you're inside of the dragon's ribcage."
1388,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Yeah.
1389,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, uh, the dragon does not see you do that, obviously, 'cause this body doesn't have a head, but with its claws it's going to swipe at Brad."
1390,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Okay.
1391,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
1392,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Brad, obviously a crowd favourite."
1393,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Um, that's- that's a-"
1394,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Y'know, it's fine, it's cool."
1395,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Seventeen versus AC, Brad."
1396,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Uh, my AC is 11."
1397,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Jesus, Brad! What is- Can I ask? What's Brad wearing? This?"
1398,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Basically this, yeah. I have a clipboard."
1399,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You're a protection fighter.
1400,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, he hits you, and sort of rakes you across the chest and you fall backwards, and you take 14 points of damage, [Stuart Okay,] and your fucking clipboard? [makes whooshing noises] goes flying into the bone pile."
1401,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I loosen my tie.
1402,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, Now it's Brad's time to shine.
1403,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1404,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, Brad. Whatchu got?"
1405,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I say
1406,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Bra- uh, Dragon. Focus on me, focus on me."
1407,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," And I keep pointing at my eyes and I keep pointing at his ribcage and I cast Compel Duel. So it can only- It has to pass a wisdom saving throw, and if it fails, it can only attack me. 'Cause I'm standing up for my buds!"
1408,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1409,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1410,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, he rolled a 9, which is okay news I guess?"
1411,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Simmer down, you gotta focus on me, man."
1412,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, uh, with that I need-"
1413,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Are you mad 'cause you don't have a head, ribcage-dragon-thing?"
1414,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, you're talkin' a lil' bit of smack, now?"
1415,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," I don't know, I think that's an honest question. Y'know, when I was-"
1416,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] Okay, okay, okay. Uh, sss-Magnus. Dad. Make a dexterity saving throw."
1417,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I haven't done anything yet.
1418,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yup.
1419,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh, it's a five... and I add-"
1420,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, Jesus. Doesn't matter. Uh, two of the dragon heads shoot a beam of green flame at you, hitting you for 21 points of damage."
1421,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I've got lots of health.
1422,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Not anymore.
1423,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Who's doing somethin'? We're so close!
1424,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Uh, yeah you go."
1425,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Go ahead. I, uh, see this incredible sacrifice that, uh, what's-his-face did-"
1426,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs],
1427,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Brad.
1428,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uh, Brad, that's right. Uh, and I cast Spiritual Weapon. I'm gonna create a flowing- I rush over to Brad and I create a- In front of him- and I create a floating spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration, uh, let's see, uh, on a hit the target takes force damage equal to one d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier."
1429,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Can I make a requ- Do you- Do you know what the Spiritual Weapon’s gonna be?
1430,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Yeah.
1431,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay. What is it?
1432,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Uh, it's- it's like a... um... it's a, umm..."
1433,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Fuck. So you didn't have an idea of what you wanted it to be?
1434,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, I didn't have an idea.
1435,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Meat tenderizer!
1436,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Can it be- can it be, uh, his clipboard, but beautiful and glowing and magical like a shield that you could use as a weapon."
1437,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Yes, I- yes, I see his clipboard, I'm so inspi-"
1438,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," That's what he has written, right here."
1439,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Yeah it says beautiful clipboard.
1440,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," O-okay, you have a new, magical, spiritual clipboard that you have, like Captain America's shield, that you can use as a weapon."
1441,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," No, no, no, no, it's his mug. "
1442,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh it's his mug, that's even better."
1443,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," It's hi- It's his giant mug, that he raises up and it's got like spikes and shit."
1444,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And what does the mug- what does the mug say on it?
1445,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," It says ""Soar,"" and then defines it ""To climb to new heights and achieve great things."""
1446,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing & cheering],
1447,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1448,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, And then I shout- [crosstalk]
1449,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, [crosstalk] I just gotta remind myself of that sometimes.
1450,MaxFunCon East Live,(J) Merle," Soar on this, motherfucker!"
1451,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, d'you wanna go ahead and use that- that weapon for an attack?"
1452,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I would love to use it as an attack.
1453,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," On one of the three heads, or the ribcage?"
1454,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, On the ribcage.
1455,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay.
1456,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, ...I roll a nine.
1457,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughs],
1458,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, ...teen?
1459,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, Nineteen.
1460,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, you have advantage on the roll because the weapon is so cool."
1461,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Oh, uhhh, no, I got a fifteen."
1462,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, th- Yeah, that is enough, it's an unarmoured, just sort of bony ribcage. Uh, you bring this thing, this- this magical cup down and, uh, hit it, and uh, let's just say you break three of the eight ribs. That's how we'll track damage in this fight. [Audience clapping] Uh, and some of those bony shards rain down on you, Ma- er, Taako, invisible inside."
1463,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Uh, from within it, I point at two of the heads and cast Banishment."
1464,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, okay. "
1465,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," I- I am still playing, right?"
1466,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, d'you wanna take a- take a- just jump in, baby, it's freeform, it's like jazz up here, it's all about the turns you don't take!"
1467,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1468,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," The dragon heads have to, uh, pass a charisma saving throw."
1469,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, that's not their jam, no. Uh, fourteen?"
1470,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, What's your spellcasting modifier?
1471,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Dad's not gonna know the answer to that- oh.
1472,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Better than that!
1473,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, yeah, two of the dragon heads just- Poof! Disappear!"
1474,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, Abra-ca-fuck you!
1475,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, it feels good!"
1476,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1477,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Alright, you got one dragon head and a damaged ribcage. Why don't you take a turn Magnus-"
1478,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, Magnus rushes in!
1479,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Fuck yeah, what're you doin'?"
1480,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," He takes, uh, old Railsplitter-!"
1481,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay,"
1482,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, -Is it Railsplitter?
1483,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yup. [Audience laughing]
1484,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," And he- and he does it two-handed, because that's even more badass, and he runs up to the third dragon and he hits him on the C7- [Griffin Okay,] Is that right? C7! Inspired by a tattoo-"
1485,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Roll that shit.
1486,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," -And it's a seventeen, by god!"
1487,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering],
1488,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Yeah. You cut-
1489,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Plus, I add nine to that, so twenty-six!"
1490,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You hit it- You hit it in one of its vertebrae and the whole neck- [Clint C7!] -the C7, a dragon's natural weak point, um, you don't need to roll damage, the neck just sort of teeters over and the- the bony sort of structure just kinda falls apart, you've destroyed the third head. Uh-"
1491,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus, Chiropract that!
1492,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, How's- is that good?
1493,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughter],
1494,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, It's- [crosstalk] It's good enough!
1495,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [crosstalk] That is my catchphrase!
1496,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Wait, Griffin, can you say it now? Can you say we- we solved it?"
1497,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, no, there's still the ribcage, it's got claws, it's still attacking you-"
1498,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Shiit.
1499,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You haven't solved any fu- I'll let you know when the dragon puzzle's been solved, Justin."
1500,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," You got something, don't you, you've got some in your hat."
1501,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, Brad, it looks like you've got somethin' you wanna do."
1502,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Uh, I was waiting for it to attack me again because- I want-"
1503,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, yeah, no, it's- this thing has not gone in a while, it definitely is gonna take another swing at Brad, um. Oh, shit, that's a critical hit."
1504,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Okay. Guys, I think this is the end of Brad."
1505,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin laughing & Audience ooh-ing],
1506,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Oh, well."
1507,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," No, you have a thing!"
1508,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, I don't have a thing!
1509,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, You're a protection dude! [crosstalk] You can force advantage!
1510,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [crosstalk] The dice rolls weren't too bad-
1511,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, [crosstalk] I- I cast Protection!
1512,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," No-! That's, no, that's done already!"
1513,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Wha-
1514,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," You take nineteen points of damage, Brad."
1515,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
1516,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Okay, I'm still alive."
1517,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] O-Okay, I was- [Audience cheering] Uh, did you wanna ha-"
1518,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You know, I'm sensing a lot of anger from you, Ribcage, um, does it stem from you not having a head?"
1519,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, The ribcage kind of like- [nodding] Nods up and down like a-
1520,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Do I have to cast Zone of Truth on you, right now?"
1521,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," It sits there and it taps its claws- [makes a ‘tktk’ noise] it goes- no, shakes its body left to right."
1522,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," You're ready to express your own truth without magic, aren't you, Ribcage."
1523,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin & Audience laughing],
1524,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [laughing] I- it sits there for a second. It goes up and down yes.
1525,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," What's bothering you right now, buddy?"
1526,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, [laughing] You see- you it's claws just go [gestures with his hands]
1527,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1528,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Griffin is indicating to his head, for those of you listening at home."
1529,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," Guys, it's your- it's his head, he's missing his head."
1530,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Oh, he's missing his head."
1531,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, I cast Calm Emotions on the ribcage.
1532,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1533,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, what does that- does that do anything?"
1534,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," Eh, it chills him out."
1535,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin & Audience laughing],
1536,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [laughing] Okay- and then- and then, uh, and then Merle casts Flame Strike on the ribcage."
1537,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1538,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] A-alright. Uh, I have to roll a dexterity saving throw, I think to get out of the way-? [Justin Indeed.] Okay. Uh, that's a two."
1539,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, He's just way too chill.
1540,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Alright so here is... Six, three, one- so, ten- and then four. "
1541,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," [Adding along] Nine, ten, fourteen."
1542,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, fourteen points of damage. You take that, definitely, Taako, since you're inside of the ribcage that he just set on fire. Oh no, make a dexterity saving throw, I'm so-"
1543,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, And then four d6 radiant damage.
1544,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Oh, Jesus."
1545,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," Two, one, two, six."
1546,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," [Quietly] Uh that's a, twelve, plus three, fifteen."
1547,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, What the hell are you guys doin'?
1548,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Sorry, what did you roll Travis?"
1549,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," [Quietly] So that's three, five, eleven."
1550,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Fifteen, which I think is-"
1551,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, yeah, you dodge through the gap in the broken ribs that, uh, Brad made for you, and get out of the way of this flame strike."
1552,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin," And then, eleven radiant damage."
1553,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, it's weak to both of those types of damage, so this ribcage just explodes."
1554,MaxFunCon East Live,[Justin & Audience laughing],
1555,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, and you have solved my Skeletal Dragon puzzle!"
1556,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering & whistling],
1557,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Let's- let's wrap this up real quick. You- a portcullis opens on the other end of the arena, leading to a long staircase leading upwards and you reach another small treasure chamber at the end of the room. This one, again, real- like a dungeon treasure chamber, not like a movie set, um- And there's a ch-"
1558,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, Bra- Oh wait-
1559,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Brad, you do the honours!"
1560,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And there's a treasure chest sitting right there.
1561,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," I think we should do it all at once, guys."
1562,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Okay, buddy."
1563,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, All four of you put your hands on the treasure chest and open it up-
1564,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, And it explodes!
1565,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And a wave of force emits from it, uh, knocking all of you backwards, and onto your backs."
1566,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus," Good call, Brad,"
1567,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Goddammit, Brad!"
1568,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus," Really good job, Brad."
1569,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako, Fuckin' dick-!
1570,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And, you feel really weak, you actually all are incapacitated right now, I mean you can't take any actions,"
1571,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [Quietly] Oh, you- oh,"
1572,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And Art's voice comes from the loudspeaker, and he says, uh"
1573,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," You all made this way too easy. Did you really not recognize me the whole time? Did you not recognize the face of the man whose life you ruined so long ago? Well I suppose it's not important now. I admit, this is a fairly circuitous method of getting my revenge, but it worked, didn't it? Goodbye, jerks."
1574,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And the loudspeaker clicks off and spikes come out of the ceiling, and suddenly the ceiling is lowering down, to kill all four of you. Do you have any final words for each other?"
1575,MaxFunCon East Live,[Silence],
1576,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus," This is your fault, Brad. Smooth move, Ex-lax. I didn't wanna open the chest but nooo, [crosstalk] do it all together."
1577,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, [crosstalk] That is not- that is not how Magnus sounds at all.
1578,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart, [crosstalk] Great character voice.
1579,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint, He does now.
1580,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Do you have any- any last words?
1581,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," [Sadly] I just wanna say- I've lost a lot- this is Magnus, but in Taako's- I wanna make that clear- And I- Okay- And I'm just glad that I found a new family! And I'm sad to lose this one too. [As if on the verge of tears?]"
1582,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing/aw-ing],
1583,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Aw... Anybody else-?
1584,MaxFunCon East Live,(T) Taako," Except for Bra- I mean we just met Brad, I think you're- You actually turned out to be not such a wang, and we probably could've been buds in another life!"
1585,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1586,MaxFunCon East Live,Justin, Taako just takes out the ruby he stole and cradles it like the old couple in Titanic.
1587,MaxFunCon East Live,[Griffin & Audience laughs],
1588,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," [Vocalizing] Neeaar, faar-"
1589,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Um, Magnus- Dad Magnus. Any last words- anything you wanna say to the crew before you're killed?"
1590,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Um, I-"
1591,MaxFunCon East Live,(C) Magnus, I wish it hadn't happened!
1592,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1593,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughs] O-okay, and Brad, final words?"
1594,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad," I had a really great time getting to know you guys this weekend, I had a lot of fun."
1595,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1596,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, as you all finish your final words, just as the spikes from above are about to impale you, the floor disappears again, and you're falling through another set of four slides! And you're going down this- these slides for like a minute, and, uh, you- you emerge from the end of the slide, and you can see daylight, and you've emerged in that very first chamber, uh, that you first went into the dungeon, the one with the- the etching on the floor that reads ""Enter colleagues, exit best friends."" And standing in front of you is Art Goodfriend! And you're back in your original bodies, you can tell you're back in your original- Oh we don't have time for-"
1597,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus," I'm back in my beautiful, big dicked body!"
1598,MaxFunCon East Live,"[Audience, Griffin, & Stuart laughing]",
1599,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, That is canonical!
1600,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Uh, and Art Goodfriend says, uh"
1601,MaxFunCon East Live,Art," That's right! Y'all just got done dirty, like The Game starring Michael Douglas. I know my methods seem a bit harsh, but how good of friends are all you right now?"
1602,MaxFunCon East Live,Stuart," I look at you guys, expectantly, waiting for you to say that we're great friends."
1603,MaxFunCon East Live,Taako," Um, one thing I did wanna tell you guys is Does anybody knows who buys rubies around here?"
1604,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1605,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," [laughing] Um, anybody else have anything they wanna say?"
1606,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, I punch Art Goodfriend.
1607,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, Okay. [Audience laughing] Make an attack roll.
1608,MaxFunCon East Live,Clint," Wait, I cast Enhance Ability on him."
1609,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Okay, yes, great! Uh, roll- gain- gain advantage on your roll!"
1610,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis," Well, I- uh, fourteen, uh, yeah, so fourteen, with Phantom Fist, that's plus eight-?"
1611,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," Yeah, you punch, you punch Art Goodfriend in the face, no need to roll damage. He sees you enhance his ability and he takes it and he, like, spits out blood-"
1612,MaxFunCon East Live,Travis, And I say
1613,MaxFunCon East Live,Magnus, That's for Brad.
1614,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin, And he spits out some blood and he goes-
1615,MaxFunCon East Live,Brad, [Quietly] That's me...
1616,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," He sees you enhance his ability, you punch him in the face, he spits out blood, and he goes"
1617,MaxFunCon East Live,Art, Teamwork.
1618,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience laughing],
1619,MaxFunCon East Live,Griffin," And that's the episode! Thank you all, for listening! Uh, this has been The Adventure Zone, I hope you liked it, and, uh, have a good rest of the Max Fun Con!"
1620,MaxFunCon East Live,[Audience cheering & clapping],
1621,MaxFunCon East Live,[Music starts playing and plays until the end],
1622,MaxFunCon East Live,[Clint laughs],
1623,MaxFunCon East Live,Convention Announcer," Ladies and Gentlemen, The Adventure Zone!"
1624,MaxFunCon East Live,[audience cheers],
