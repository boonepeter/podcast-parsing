8,Nashville Live Show,Announcer," Before presenting you with our tale of high adventure, I have a deadly important question for you, Nashville. Are you tres horny for this one? It’s The Adventure Zone!"
9,Nashville Live Show,[THEME MUSIC," ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson]"

11,Nashville Live Show,Travis, And now it’s time to switch to my prescription glasses.

14,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [sheepish] Hey everybody.
15,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
16,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Whew!
17,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Before we get going, is there any way we can get full house lights and- so we can see all the cosplay? Because we’ve only been following it through Twitter, and— [crosstalk]"
18,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Yeah, lights up. If you are doing cosplay, stand up!"

20,Nashville Live Show,Clint, God!

29,Nashville Live Show,Justin, So good.
30,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
31,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Ohhh!
32,Nashville Live Show,Justin," There’s one person here dressed like Naruto [pronounced Nuh-roo-doh, all say it the same way], and like I get it, but could you not? It’s kind of our…[crosstalk] thing…"
33,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Please dress like Naruto! Don’t Naruto-shame them!
34,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Also, is Naruto a character, or is… [crosstalk]"
35,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Oh no!
36,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] No one’s quite sure. Uh...
37,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I also don’t know!
38,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] I don’t know the answer.
39,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] It’s a state of mind.
40,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You can turn the lights down now, I’m having a panic attack. And there they go, there they go, there they go… [crosstalk] and they don’t exist, it’s just the four of us!"
41,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] They’re gone, they’re gone. It’s just us four."
42,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
43,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Who’s laughing? I don’t know.
44,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Whew!
45,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, how do we…"
46,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Could you turn ‘em off on stage, too? [Justin & Griffin laugh] Just make it a super chill night?"
47,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
48,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, y’all wanna-"
49,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [movie trailer voice] In the beginning…
50,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Y’all wanna just get, get, get going, get into it? It’s been about two months since we’ve played Dungeons and Dragons, so this should be interesting."
51,Nashville Live Show,{5,16}
52,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
53,Nashville Live Show,Clint, What’s my password on this? [his phone; audience laughs]
54,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Holy shiiiiiiiiiitt.

56,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Laugh at it!
57,Nashville Live Show,Travis, He knows his password!
58,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Listen, this is America, you can laugh at any shit [crosstalk] you wanna laugh at!"
59,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] No!
60,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Gettin’-
61,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Also! Also no.

63,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I solv— I’m good.
64,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright. Uh, let’s get going. Y’all ready?"
65,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I don’t have… the one with 20…
66,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Are you fucking kidding me?
67,Nashville Live Show,Travis, You have two giant ones— [crosstalk]
68,Nashville Live Show,Justin," The big ones! Ok, the big ones, yeah, thes- deez nuts right here. These- [crosstalk] are twenties."
69,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Travis do you have a joke you wanna do [crosstalk] about being unprepared?
70,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] No! I am prepared and a good good D&D boy!
71,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Good.
72,Nashville Live Show,Justin, There are some though—
73,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
74,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Legit, and this should add some fun tension, there are some I don’t have, and I don’t know exactly [crosstalk] off the top of my head."
75,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I got extries.
76,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Ok.
77,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Trav’s got a bunch. Alright! Let’s do it.
78,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Ok… [pause] D4, for example…"
79,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. It’s a—
80,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I got— Oh! Shit! I don’t have that.
81,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Holy shit!
82,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I got a four! I got up a four! I got a four!
83,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] I just found a D4!
84,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Ok, you’ve got a D4..."
85,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] The one with 20 sides...
86,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] That’s mine! Wait that’s my D4!  
87,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Ok this is Travis’s D4, but we’re kinda sharing it."
88,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, This is gonna be the whole episode.
89,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Joint custody D4.
90,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Before we walked out, Griffin said “no jokes about not knowing how to play the game, we have a lotta story to get to,” so I wanna clarify none of this has been jokes."
91,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Good.
92,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Not a joke in the b— in the—
93,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Should we introduce ourselves?
94,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Sure, yeah. I— yeah, sure. Who has not listened to The Adventure Zone before?"
95,Nashville Live Show,"[audience is almost silent, a few cheers]",
96,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright, yeah..."
97,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I heard one lonely, [crosstalk] single—"
98,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] What the hell are you doing here?
99,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," No, don’t— don’t Naruto-shame them. Justin, who are you playing today?"
100,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, my name is Justin McElroy and I play the elven wizard Taako."
101,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
102,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Uh, I am Travis McElroy and I play the human fighter Magnus Burnsides."
103,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
104,Nashville Live Show,Clint," And I am Clint McElroy, and I play dwarven cleric Merle Highchurch."
105,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
106,Nashville Live Show,Clint, And I have never gotten that right in a live [crosstalk] show.
107,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] You— I thought for sure you were gonna fuck it up. I’m Griffin McElroy, I play everybody else. That’s Paul—"
108,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
109,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Aww!
110,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Dice!
111,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Aww!
112,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Paul came out here with two dice bags—
113,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Yeah, yeah!"
114,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Oh, and a ‘great job’ pump. My hero, and yours, Paul. Let’s do the adventure!"
115,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Be careful! Because in there is an actual ring of mine from my baby’s birth. Please don’t lose that.
116,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I don’t—
117,Nashville Live Show,Travis, It’s not a joke!
118,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Y’know, I’ll just make up a number then. Like, what are you doing? You can’t just put that kind of pressure on me. All right—"
119,Nashville Live Show,{7,51}
120,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, THE THREE OF YOU! [audience laughs] Are we ready?
121,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah."
122,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] I see a lot of fiddlin’ and fartin’ around! 
123,Nashville Live Show,Justin, ‘Kay.
124,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I’m just gonna start talkin’. The three of you are sitting in stylish, high-backed chairs in front of… a blackjack table. Sitting—"
125,Nashville Live Show,[audience ‘oooh’s],
126,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," ‘Oooooh’! Sitting across from you is a dealer, a half-ogre gentleman dressed to the nines with a bright red vest and a nametag on it that says “Crush.” [audience laughs] This scene is in the middle of an enormous casino pit, and all around you other folks are playing table games - craps, poker, roulette - while others sit at seemingly-endless rows of slot machines, dumping buckets of gold coins into them all night. "
127,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Baccarat? Is there Baccarat?
128,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, There’s definitely...not Baccarat. 
129,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Is there Burt Bacharach?
130,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," There is, yes. Fantasy Burt Bacharach. Uh, the three of you are also dressed to the nines. What are you wearing for this stylish casino atmosphere?"
131,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
132,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Sleeveless tuxedo.
133,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
134,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Tuxedo sleeves.
135,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
136,Nashville Live Show,Travis, We only had the money for the one!
137,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
138,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, I had to choose between formal, business-casual, and Taako, and I went ahead and went with Taako."
139,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure."
140,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Also but I did get the Cloak of the Manta Ray, cuz I figured eventually—"
141,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Show that off, by the way? Somebody just sent you the Cloak of the Manta Ray and it’s so fucking tight—"
142,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
143,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It’s super good. Alright, so—"
144,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Now Dad, show off your swim trunks!"
145,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Dad’s just wearing swim trunks with his costume.
146,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin & audience laugh],
147,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Swim trunks— swim trunks that he forgot, and made someone go back to the hotel to get for him, and we’re all like ‘oh these pants that we’re hearing about, these are gonna be [crosstalk] outta sight, like so fresh”..."
148,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] So dope.
149,Nashville Live Show,Justin, They are.
150,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Beach. Dwarf.
151,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [overlapping] Yeah.
152,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [overlapping] No, it tracks!"
153,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [overlapping] No no no, we get it, yeah yeah yeah—"
154,Nashville Live Show,Travis," It tracks! But I wasn’t expecting swim trunks. When they brought them in, I thought you would say ‘oh this is embarrassing, but you’re gonna have to go back’—"
155,Nashville Live Show,Clint, They’re actually board… trunks… Am I right?
156,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
157,Nashville Live Show,Travis," B-O-R-E-D, ‘cuz we’re talking about it too much!"
158,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, instead of doin’ the podcast! So the three of you have been sittin’ at this blackjack table for a while, uh, how— how has your game been going? Any of you particularly—"
159,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Magnus bets wildly and poorly.
160,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
161,Nashville Live Show,Travis," He doubles-down on like, thirteen. Not a good call."
162,Nashville Live Show,{10,16}
163,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Crush— Crush, sitting opposite you, the dealer, says"
164,Nashville Live Show,Crush, You boys havin’ a good time? Old Blue Eyes makes sure that everyone has a good time in his place.
165,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Are you— are you [high-pitched] Old Blue Eyes?
166,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, He points to his nametag.
167,Nashville Live Show,Crush, I’m Crush. I—
168,Nashville Live Show,Taako," You can forgive us for assuming that you were trying to get some sort of name, nickname going, I mean—"
169,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Yeah!
170,Nashville Live Show,Crush, Old— Old Blue Eyes runs the joint. You’re coming here and you don’t know who Old Blue Eyes is?
171,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Sinatra!
172,Nashville Live Show,Crush, Who?
173,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Oh-kay!
174,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Cool. You did— you [Griffin] created that trap and you [Clint] did walk into it [crosstalk] so that was kind of a duo—
175,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Aww!
176,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," While you’ve been playing, you’ve also been on edge, because you’re waiting for something to happen. The table you’re at [crosstalk] is-"
177,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] In our lives!
178,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The table you’re at is 20 feet from a guarded door into the casino back room where two half-ogre pit bosses are watching the room and your table in particular. And you hear them also exchange words about Old Blue Eyes. One of them says they heard he’s actually in the building tonight, which is apparently—"
179,Nashville Live Show,Travis," At what age do you think he becomes Old Blue Eyes? Cuz that’s gotta be hurtful, right, where it’s like “I’m Blue Eyes!”, and it’s like “Hey it’s Old Blue Eyes!”, “Ahh…”"
180,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and the three of you have been exchanging these sort of furtive glances all evening, waiting for a signal for the next part of your plan to begin. And, it’s during one of those glances that you’re interrupted, Taako, as you feel a hand on your shoulder as someone moves to your side, and you hear a voice say,"
181,Nashville Live Show,Woman’s Voice, Is this seat taken?
182,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
183,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Uh, no, no, Ma’am-Who-Is-A-Stranger-To-Me! By all means!"
184,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And there, wearing a sharp, flashy, black ensemble and wide-brimmed hat… is your twin sister Lup."
185,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
186,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I also wanna say, bold choice with the stranger thing, you do look—"
187,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Exactly alike.
188,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You are twins.
189,Nashville Live Show,Clint, You’re twins.
190,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You see Lup, who nods at all three of you with a devious smile, and then we see all four of you as the camera pans out, showing the scope of this enormous gaming hall, and then it zooms out even further to show us the exterior of this opulent casino, and a steady crowd is pouring in as flood lights shine into the sky over [{1237} “Doing Some Crime” starts] a bright neon sign showcasing the name of this establishment"
191,Nashville Live Show,“The Grand Grimaldis Casino”,
192,Nashville Live Show,"[audience erupts, music continues]",
193,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Played by Al Pacino!
194,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, No.
195,Nashville Live Show,Justin, No.
196,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," We’re in a flashback to several nights ago. The three of you are sitting at a round table where crudely-drawn blueprints of the casino are rolled out. And as you’re surveying the designs, four belts equipped with some sort of mechanical device thunk down on the table and Lup joins you. Can you turn down the pump-up music a little bit? It’s a little assertive."
197,Nashville Live Show,"Lup says,",
198,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I’ve brought you here today because I’ve got some unfinished business back in our home world that needs taken care of.
199,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
200,Nashville Live Show,Lup," When I was younger, before I discovered how rad explosion magic can be, I used to dabble in Transmutation magic, and during that period, I created something powerful. An artifact that could self-replicate, giving its owner an endless hoard of cash over time. A magically-imbued fifteen-dollar bill."
201,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
202,Nashville Live Show,Lup," It was taken from me by Greg-fuckin’-Grimaldis just— just before our exit from that world. I aim to get it back. Now, he’s used that seed money to become an infinitely wealthy warlord in our homeworld, and the base of his operation is this The Grand Grimaldis Casino. I need the three of you to help me infiltrate that casino and retrieve and destroy the fifteen-dollar bills. So, anyone up for a proper casino heist?"
203,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Yay!
204,Nashville Live Show,Merle, Yeah!
205,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
206,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Uh, I’m going to have to look to my moral guide, Merle Highchurch—"
207,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," If we commit a crime, in a different plane, does it count?"
208,Nashville Live Show,Merle," M-maybe? It depends, does—"
209,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Stop.
210,Nashville Live Show,Merle, Does Greg—
211,Nashville Live Show,Justin," No, stop. Are you saying this to him as Clinton McElroy, my father, or are you saying this to him as Merle Highchurch, popular fantasy cleric?"
212,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Oh, God."
213,Nashville Live Show,Justin," These people paid a lot of fuckin’ money, and they didn’t come here to hear you, be you, when you’re you— not you."
214,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Please, forgive me, paying public."
215,Nashville Live Show,Merle, I say Grimaldis is a prick. 
216,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
217,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Lup goes on and says,"
218,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Since we took down The Hunger, the barrier between realities has become impermeable, but with these belts, we’ll be able to enter that reality for as long as they remain charged, which should give us a narrow eighty-minute window to get in, and get the artifact."
219,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [laughs] About live-show length!
220,Nashville Live Show,Lup," It is imperative that we don’t get caught, or we’ll lose precious time in the process. Now, the first challenge is gonna be—"
221,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Oh shit, a stealth mission! [unsure sounds]"
222,Nashville Live Show,Taako, You’ve come to the right people!
223,Nashville Live Show,Lup, Most— most heists are…
224,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Oh wait! This is post-rogue training!
225,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah you’re good. Uh,"
226,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Now the first challenge is gonna be breaking into the back rooms of the casino from the gaming pit. The three of you will sit here, at this blackjack table closest to the door to these back rooms. I’ll do a couple laps around the pit to make sure there’s no surprises waiting for us there, then join you for our assault. Now, that door is likely to be heavily guarded, so, before we’ll be able to make our way into the employee-only area, we’ll probably have to create a distraction. "
227,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Done!
228,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Following that, the four of us will slip inside unnoticed. Any questions?"
229,Nashville Live Show,[beat of total silence],
230,Nashville Live Show,Lup, Cool!
231,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
232,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and I guess we’ve flashed forward back to the present. Lup winks and it’s time for the heist to begin, but like she said, before you can move into the back rooms, you need to create a distraction. What do you dooo, herooooooeeeessssssss?"
233,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I stand up— or [mumbling] Magnus stands up, I’m not Magnus— and points at Crush and goes,"
234,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, He’s bottom dealing!
235,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Ooh, good."
236,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Ooh, that is good. Roll a Deception check, cause you’re—"
237,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Well that ain’t good.
238,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
239,Nashville Live Show,Travis," That’s a seven plus one, an eight."
240,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, No.
241,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
242,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Just kidding!
243,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," One of the two pit bosses comes over from the door that you’re supposed to get through, and walks over and says"
244,Nashville Live Show,Pit Boss," Crush, what seems to be the problem here?"
245,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And Crush says
246,Nashville Live Show,Crush," Well… Slam, I—"
247,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
248,Nashville Live Show,Crush," This guy’s causing a big stink, I don’t know why, [begins to sob] I’m doin’ my best. I’m doin’ my best."
249,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m— I’m gonna try a second tactic here.
250,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, [super drunkenly] I-I charge this— he’s now— he’s bottom dealing! Hiccup! Hiccup!
251,Nashville Live Show,Crush, He suddenly got super fake-drunk all of a—
252,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, [sounds of protestation] I’m totally drunk!
253,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, I guess make another Deception check.
254,Nashville Live Show,Travis," That’s an eighteen plus one, nineteen."
255,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
256,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I throw up on myself to make it a little more convincing.
257,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, I think with a nineteen, you fake-drunk so good you just barf. What’s the game plan here, Travis McElroy?"
258,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Well, my hope is that my two friends will try to drag me away cause I’m clearly drunk, and I can create a ruckus."
259,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright we’re gonna flashback again, and you are relaying that to those two."
260,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Yeah, I’m gonna fake-drunk—"
261,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Lup says,"
262,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I don’t think this is gonna work.
263,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," No, I’ll create a big hubbub by being like fake-drunk and then you guys come and get me all—"
264,Nashville Live Show,Merle," Yeah but if we help you off, there’s nobody left to take advantage of—"
265,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," I’ll flip the table so that they have to like, clean it up. And there’s gonna be chips everywhere and money everywhere."
266,Nashville Live Show,Taako," I— I do want to say I’m so glad you decided to, uh, throw yourself a UCB Harold show when I can set things on fire with my mind. This is literally the path of least resistance, this fuckin’ Second City skit you’ve-"
267,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] I think— I think we’ve, uh—"
268,Nashville Live Show,Taako, [crosstalk] -you’ve written.
269,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I think we are flashed forward back to the— back to the heist, and uh, Taako, seeing sort of the clumsy attempt that Magnus has—"
270,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [indignant] Clumsy? I rolled it and I got a nineteen!
271,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You did alright. Uh, Taako. What are you— what do you do to create a distraction?"
272,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, I, uh— [laughs] I literally have a spell called Programmed Illusion that I set just for this, when this—"
273,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Okay.
274,Nashville Live Show,Justin," When this failed, uh, it is—"
275,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [insistent] Nineteen!
276,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Sorry?
277,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [indignant] Nineteen, I rolled a nineteen and it failed!"
278,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
279,Nashville Live Show,Clint," That was to puke on yourself, and you—"
280,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Yeah, and I puked real good!"
281,Nashville Live Show,Clint, You did it—
282,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I puked super good!
283,Nashville Live Show,Clint," You did it, didn’t he, guys? Didn’t he puke like a big boy?"
284,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
285,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I puked sooo good, like, it did, like, spirals!"
286,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, What is your programmed illusion?
287,Nashville Live Show,Justin," It’s uh, their boss…"
288,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Old Blue Eyes?
289,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Old Blue Eyes, and he says,"
290,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes, I’m very convinced by this puking!
291,Nashville Live Show,Justin, And they— that’s what he says.
292,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [laughing, incredulous] Does he just appear?"
293,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] No!
294,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [mimicking Illusory Old Blue Eyes] I just had new felt put on these tables!
295,Nashville Live Show,Justin," He comes out of a co— he comes out of the crowd, and he’s like— cause they were watching the puking—"
296,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay, okay, okay, yeah that works."
297,Nashville Live Show,Justin," And he like comes out of the crowd, he’s like"
298,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes, I’m very convinced by this puking!
299,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright, this uh, this illusory… dude… with bright blue eyes and jet-black hair, uh, walks through the crowd and says"
300,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," Yeah let’s uh, let’s—"
301,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Wait, what does he sound like? I don’t know, cause I wasn’t expecting him this early."
302,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
303,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says, uh,"
304,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," Oh man, we can’t have a guy like this in the— in the crowd with yartz all over him, what uh… let’s take care of this, huh?"
305,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Actually, you should talk for your illusory dude you made, probably not me."
306,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Yeah, but I don’t know what he sounds like."
307,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, I think I like that! I think then— you don’t know what he sounds like!
308,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
309,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, that’s going to be confusing for you folks out there, but let’s give it a shot."
310,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Character voice!
311,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
312,Nashville Live Show,Justin," What are you talk— [to the audience] no, don’t, no, no, no, no, no, no. When he goes astray, it’s not your job to reinforce that. Your job is to be there when he falls and help pick him back up and—"
313,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Alright.
314,Nashville Live Show,Justin," —sometimes that’s accomplished through silence. Um, no I wasn’t doing a character voice, I was just trying to be Justin McElroy, and I think that, uh… I, I mean it’s like… [snorts]"
315,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
316,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," [stereotypical Italian mobster from Brooklyn accent] Ay, I’m r-really convinced by ah, this guy’s pukin’, ah… over here… "
317,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
318,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Roll a, roll a Deception check."
319,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes, Booshk!
320,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, yeah, yeah, roll a Deception check with one of the big ones."
321,Nashville Live Show,Justin, That’s a natural twenty.
322,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
323,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s flat—"
324,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] God! Did it light up?
325,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Every— everyone in the building goes—
326,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Did it light up?
327,Nashville Live Show,Travis, It did.
328,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Yeah, it’s flashing, it’s flashing, as you can attest."
329,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [cackles]
330,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, alright, I— I think Crush says,"
331,Nashville Live Show,Crush," Boss, you sound sick, but it’s definitely you."
332,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Haha!
333,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I think with a twenty, you actually—"
334,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Does it just keep flashing?
335,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I think with a twenty, you just changed what Greg Grimaldis’s actual voice sounds like."
336,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, good. S’about right."
337,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, okay, they have bought into it, and now you have this illusory Greg Grimaldis that everybody’s kind of paying deference to. What’s the next step in this wild plan you’ve concocted?"
338,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Where are we trying to get to?
339,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, this door that these two, uh, half-ogres are— were guarding, one of them peeled off to investigate the loud—"
340,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," Hey, listen! I don’t pay you guys to not get mops when people throw up! Go get the mops!"
341,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, alright, Crush, Slam, and the third half-ogre [crosstalk], who are all—"
342,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," Hey and listen, Bump, get the real nice mops that we keep farther away."
343,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin and the audience laugh],
344,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes, The real choice mops—
345,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] The special occasion mops!
346,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," The real nice, choice mops!"
347,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] The holiday mops!
348,Nashville Live Show,Illusory Old Blue Eyes," The company mops, y’know?"
349,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Lup says—
350,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] For when whales puke!
351,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Lup says,"
352,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I can’t wait to see these excellent mops!
353,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Oh that’s right.
354,Nashville Live Show,Merle," Listen. I’ve gotta get him to a place where he can lay down, so that if he pukes, he chokes."
355,Nashville Live Show,Crush???, You’re a st—
356,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] They’re gone.
357,Nashville Live Show,Crush???," You’re a stranger here [Griffin laughing], all right, this isn’t your house, it’s a—"
358,Nashville Live Show,Merle, I’m a trained professional.
359,Nashville Live Show,Crush???, [relenting] Okaay.
360,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, alright, I think the half-ogres are pulled away and you are— the four of you are here with this illusory dude—"
361,Nashville Live Show,Travis," We do— we do that, we go through the— we go through the door."
362,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay! The— the four of you walk through this back door. What happens with your— I think your illusory Greg Grimaldis— I’m going to— it just evaporates because otherwise this heist is gonna be very, very easy."
363,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Yeah, he died, it was a short-term kinda thing."
364,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright, the four of you make it through the door into the back rooms and, uh, the door shuts behind you. And I think as— as, uh, as you do, you hear this, like, sparking sound? And you turn around to see Lup, and she has her finger out, and it’s almost like she’s trying to light a uh, uh, what are those things that people—"
365,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Acetylene torch?
366,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh yeah, torch, but with her finger? And she, like, fuses the lock shut so nobody else can follow you in."
367,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Magnus rips his, uh, vomit-y tuxedo off. Now he’s just shirtlesssss."
368,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
369,Nashville Live Show,Travis, And there’s lots of beautiful scars.
370,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Sssuuurrreee? 
371,Nashville Live Show,Travis," And a Loch Ness Monster tattoo, very similar to the one I have."
372,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, we’re back in the flashback to a few nights ago, and Lup, uh, directs your attention to the blueprints, which show the back rooms behind the gaming pit, your second destination for the heist, and she says,"
373,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Once we make it past the pit, we’ll need to work our way past the security station in the back hallways, and toward the vault in the center of the casino. Now, hopefully, at this point we won’t have the whole place on top of us, which should make it easy to slip past the security station’s, uh, large glass window looking into that hallway, and towards the vault entrance around the corner. So long as we stay out of their sightlines, we should be in the clear."
374,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And we are back in the present, and sure enough the four of you are standing in a, uh, a long hallway extending 40 feet in front of you before it reaches a corner that veers off to the right. And on the left side of this hallway, there’s an entrance into the casino’s main security office, and just past that door is a 15-foot-long, floor-to-ceiling glass divider leading into that office. And inside you can hear several deep voices trying to communicate with security forces at various points in the casino, you hear several, uh, heated discussions with the crew in the pit who are dealing with the, the mess you left behind. By the way, I put that in the notes, knowing that there would some sort of literal mess."
375,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
376,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," In order to proceed down this hallway, you need to get past that window without being detected. What do you do?"
377,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I cast Insect Plague.
378,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Fuck.
379,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Fuck, that’s so s—"
380,Nashville Live Show,Travis," No, that’s the opposite!"
381,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, No no no no no!
382,Nashville Live Show,Justin, No. I cast Silence.
383,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, No no no no no. [crosstalk] You do not.
384,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I cast ‘Punch Dad’.
385,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Order of operations. Dad’s pulling a Fargo and I wanna see how it goes. You cast an Insect Plague—
386,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Insect Plague.
387,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [singsong] Wherrrrrrrrrrrree?
388,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Over the windowwwww…
389,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, What the fuck?
390,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
391,Nashville Live Show,Travis," ‘Eyy, it’s another one of those Insect Plagues’ [crosstalk]"
392,Nashville Live Show,Justin," ‘Ah, god dammit!’"
393,Nashville Live Show,Travis," ‘So normal at this point, I don’t even have to go check it!’"
394,Nashville Live Show,Clint, They’re not gonna come in! They’ll stay in the—
395,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, They’ll come outside! It’s a—
396,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Why!? It’s insects, it’s a plague, who would wanna walk into that willingly? [Justin laughs] ‘Ooooooh, insects! Let’s stay in here until they go away!’"
397,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Once again, I do wanna point out, I was like ‘oh, I’ll create a distraction’ and Dad’s like ‘I’ll create a thing!’ when we have an illusion wizard."
398,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," No, we gotta spread the fun arouuuund."
399,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Yeah. I wa—
400,Nashville Live Show,Clint, What do I roll? A twenty?
401,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I, actually, while this was happening, like, turned invisible— let me mark down my spell sheet— and walked to the other end of the hall. And I’m just kinda, like, enjoying—"
402,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And Lup’s— Lup’s already over there, she, like—"
403,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I’m also gonna roll a Stealth check ‘cuz I have, lemme check, plus 11."
404,Nashville Live Show,Justin, We’re seeing if there’s any rare Pokémon here— [crosstalk]
405,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] So, I mean, it’s a 15. It’s a 4 but I have a plus 11."
406,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, Magnus makes himself small and just rolls along along the length of the window, and leaving Merle, uh, and you [crosstalk] and bugs—"
407,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Okay!
408,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [overlapping] Just start channelling bugs at the window!
409,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [overlapping] Like the fucking, like, Mummy!"
410,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [overlapping] Bugs! Are all f— covering the window...
411,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Can they come out of his mouth? I’m sure they did. 
412,Nashville Live Show,"[Justin & Travis mimic spewing bugs, a la the Hom-Dai in ‘The Mummy’]",
413,Nashville Live Show,Clint, So do I roll? [crosstalk]
414,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Sneaky!
415,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Brendan Fraser looks on from the glass window, terrified."
416,Nashville Live Show,Clint," So I roll a 20, right?"
417,Nashville Live Show,[a small tap sound as Clint attempts to drop a D20 in his dice tower],
418,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Doesn’t fit!
419,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] [overlapping] It got stuck in the dice tower!
420,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [overlapping] It’s stuck in his dice tower.
421,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Your big dice got stuck in the tower!
422,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Also, thanks to whoever made these, didn’t look the name up, we’ll know it after intermission."
423,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Sorry about that! It got stuck in the tower, though, that’s fantastic."
424,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay.
425,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Okay, so, how ‘bout if enough— [crosstalk]"
426,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] If— what is it? What’s the dice?
427,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Seven.
428,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Je-sus!
429,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Okay. And I add that to my modifier.
430,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay. And what’s that, off the top of your head?"
431,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [whispered] Shit… eight! My modifier is eight! So it’s fifteen.
432,Nashville Live Show,Justin," People who know more about D&D, does that sound like a thing? Eight?"
433,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Yeah.
434,Nashville Live Show,Justin, S’that sound tasty to you? Five? [crosstalk]
435,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] So—
436,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Five feels, like, righter to me?"
437,Nashville Live Show,Clint," And the insects only cover the bottom third of the window, and since I’m short, I just walk riight oon paast…"
438,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Wait, hold on."
439,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
440,Nashville Live Show,Travis, You don’t get to dictate how it goes.
441,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I cast it!
442,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright, I’m gonna roll a Constitution saving throw for all the guards in this room real quick. I’m trying to make this happen. [dice rolls] That’s a four, plus…[exhales] fuck off! There’s no— I had no number prepared for this. Uh, that is— I’m gonna say that’s insufficient. What I think happens is, uh, bugs are covering this window, and while they cover the window, you sprint past. But you hear voices inside go,"
443,Nashville Live Show,Guards, What the fuuuuuck?
444,Nashville Live Show,"And start to come outside. Uh, and as they do, they are swarmed by bugs, and say,",
445,Nashville Live Show,Guards, Oh noooo!
446,Nashville Live Show,"And shut the door, and start talking into their, uh, their radios to the other guards throughout the casino, and pretty soon you hear pounding at the door that Lup just fused shut.",
447,Nashville Live Show,Travis," We out! We out the door! We’re down! Elevator, whatever’s there, [crosstalk] we’re doing it."
448,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Uh, it wor— it worked?"
449,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
450,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," There’s a certain level of awareness now, uh, but I guess we’ll cross that bridge when we… get to it - right now. As you reach the end of the hallway and turn the corner, uh, Magnus, you bump into someone. A small man in his early 20s with bushy red hair, dressed in the security uniform you’ve seen several other members of the casino staff wearing to this point, and he looks aghast as you run into him—"
451,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I begin to punch him!
452,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, He leans— [crosstalk]
453,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] but I don’t...complete it?
454,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He leans back— oh, before you punch him, he says— come on, uh—"
455,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [rising in pitch] I know that’s why I said ‘begin to punch him’ because I knew you were up to something?
456,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
457,Nashville Live Show,Red-Haired Man," [kinda dweeby voice] Hey, wait a minute, you’re not supposed to be back here!"
458,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
459,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, This isn’t anybody. 
460,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
461,Nashville Live Show,Red-Haired Man," I don’t think Old Blue Eyes wants you to be back here, right? Wait a minute! [pause] Are the three of you in the middle of a heist? That is so cool!"
462,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Awesome.
463,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Hey, yeah, good."
464,Nashville Live Show,Red-Haired Man," My name’s Terry, I, uh, I work here. What’s y’all’s names?"
465,Nashville Live Show,[pause],
466,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, [unsure] ...Magnus Burnsides.
467,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
468,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," I’m rollin’ some bones on ya, Terry!"
469,Nashville Live Show,Terry, Are you the one that made all the bugs come out? I heard about the bugs!
470,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," No! [crosstalk] No, no no no."
471,Nashville Live Show,Merle, [crosstalk] That was me! George Cl- Cloovey.
472,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," I— listen guys, I think Terry’s cool."
473,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Terry, my name is Angus McDonald. You can write that down… in your notes."
474,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And if the police show up later—
475,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Later, tell ‘em it was me, the… Thievery Kid."
476,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin & Clint laugh],
477,Nashville Live Show,{30,31}
478,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
479,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Well my name’s Terry, uh, Angus and Magnus—"
480,Nashville Live Show,Taako, With a P? Silent P at the beginning or no? Just regular—
481,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Like pterodactyl!
482,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Puh-Terry!
483,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Puh-Terry.
484,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Like the character from Pee-Wee’s Playhouse. 
485,Nashville Live Show,Terry," I see. No, it’s just—"
486,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Fantasy Pee-Wee’s Playhouse!
487,Nashville Live Show,Terry, Just big-T Terry!
488,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Alright Big-T Terry, you seem cool. Are you cool?"
489,Nashville Live Show,Terry," I’m super cool! I— I work here but it sucks, it’s a shit job! Old Blue Eyes doesn’t pay us very well, my benefits are just straight garbo."
490,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Yeah…
491,Nashville Live Show,Terry," If y’all are doing a heist, lemme get up in this heist! I can help get ya into the vault, and then maybe can split the—"
492,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Could you— could you pretend to have a different voice if you’re gonna stay with us for an extended period of time?
493,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
494,Nashville Live Show,Terry, Why don’t I help get y’all into the vault and then we can split the loot [crosstalk] five ways.
495,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, [crosstalk] Yeah but maybe just drop it an octave or two.
496,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Um—
497,Nashville Live Show,        Terry," [still dweeby, pitched lower] I can help!"
498,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Nah, that’s worse."
499,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Can I do— can I do, and I don’t know, D&D doesn’t have, like, good things for this, but um, can I do, like, an intelligence check to get a vibe [crosstalk] on Terry?"
500,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Insight.
501,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It’s Insight, it has a literal one for this. Don’t shit on D&D, it has a literal—"
502,Nashville Live Show,Travis, IT’S A ONE.
503,Nashville Live Show,Justin," That’s a one. I don’t get shit off of that, I dunno."
504,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Terry’s— Terry’s— Ter— Well, well a one...Terry is…"
505,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Terry’s Terry!
506,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] It’s just Terry.
507,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] He’s an inscrutable—
508,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] And even that is, like somewhat unclear."
509,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] He’s an inscrutable cloud, man!"
510,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
511,Nashville Live Show,Terry," [original dweeby voice] I can get ya into the, into the, the vault. We’ll just split the loot five ways. What do ya say?"
512,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I rolled a 19 Insight on Terry.
513,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, Terry wants to get you up in that vault."
514,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Alright.
515,Nashville Live Show,Merle, You know what? We can definitely [suspiciously] split the loot five waaayyys…
516,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," You know what, Merle? We don’t have to say it [imitates Merle’s tone] liiike thaaaaat."
517,Nashville Live Show,Merle, [imitating Magnus] Well we- I- diiiiiid…
518,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Ignore him, he’s-"
519,Nashville Live Show,Merle, I diiiiid!
520,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Thank you.
521,Nashville Live Show,        Magnus," But yes. Yes, Terry, you’re in. You’re our— [crosstalk]"
522,Nashville Live Show,        Taako, [crosstalk] Welcome to the squad!
523,Nashville Live Show,        Magnus, Fifth.
524,Nashville Live Show,        Taako, Taako’s Five!
525,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin and audience laugh],
526,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Terry leads, uh, the four of you around, uh, the corner at the end of the hallway, and you see a large, round door leading into the vault. Uh, at the end of that hallway, uh, and flanking that large door, are two panels, one with a loudspeaker and another one with a card slot. Uh, and on the right side of this hallway is a row of, like, twenty lockers, or so? Each one emblazoned with the names of members of, uh, various security personnel. You see “Crush”— [crosstalk], and “Slam”, and “Cram”—"
527,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] We did this, I’m pretty sure, in the mining thing…"
528,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Oh shit, we did do this in the mining one. This is— different twenty lockers."
529,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs at Griffin realizing he goofed his own puzzle],
530,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Upon further inspection, the two panels flanking the door seem to be some sort of lock, uh, on the door to the vault access corridor, or just the vault. Them the panel on the left has a button next to the speaker, which you assume to be some sort of voice lock, uh, and the other is a slot for some sort of key card. Uh, and sure enough, because you’re working with Terry, he walks over to the key card slot, takes a key card out of his vest, or whatever?, and slides it through and it turns green-"
531,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Griffin?
532,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeeeeeeeeesssss?
533,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Did you invent Terry because we weren’t moving fast enough through this mission?
534,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [laughing] ‘Hi, my name is Real Terry-’"
535,Nashville Live Show,Travis, ‘I was definitely planned into this!’
536,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Part of me assumed you would just kill Terry instantly, which, in my defense, you almost did."
537,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [rising pitch] I almost did?
538,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Terry walks, after, uh, getting the green light on the card slot, he walks over to the, uh, the speaker panel, and he says,"
539,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Uh, could you all give me a little space, please? Just back up a few feet? This part’s kind of...embarrassing. "
540,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Are we sure we trust Puh-Terry?
541,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Sure. I rolled- I got a 19. I trust Terry.
542,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] He’s good.
543,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m with Terry! Hashtag I’m With Terry.
544,Nashville Live Show,Terry," I didn’t pick my password, and it’s embarrassing. I don’t want you guys to hear it, can you please gimme some space?"
545,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," No can do, Terry."
546,Nashville Live Show,Taako," No, it’s fine, give him some space."
547,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Okay, okay."
548,Nashville Live Show,Merle," Yeah, we won’t listen."
549,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He walks over to the— you— he walks over to the, uh, the keypad and he kinda [muffled] cups his mouth around it—"
550,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Wait, hold on. Uh, I wanna cast, uh, a spell that puts a eye over there so I can hear him."
551,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
552,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Then I would put an ear over there [crosstalk], to hear it."
553,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Wait, what?"
554,Nashville Live Show,{34,40}
555,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] I want— yeah. Put a—
556,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] You have a ear? 
557,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He sees you— he sees you start to channel a spell and he says,"
558,Nashville Live Show,Terry," My password is Turkey Boy, ok? "
559,Nashville Live Show,Justin, There we go. Arcane Eye—
560,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He goes,"
561,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Greg— Greg saw me eating a turkey sandwich on my first day, and he just wouldn’t shut up about it. It doesn’t even make any sense, it’s not even a good slam! "
562,Nashville Live Show,Taako," God, I hate Greg Grimaldis. "
563,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Lup is cracking up, she’s like crying "
564,Nashville Live Show,"laughing, and she’s like,",
565,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Turkey Boy! Oh, man, Greg Grimaldis is a total dick, but that’s good stuff right there. "
566,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And Terry—
567,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Good stuff? Turkey?
568,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [reluctantly] ...I guess?
569,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
570,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Don’t! Please! You only have to deal with him for this hour and twenty minutes, we have to live with him!"
571,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I’m so glad you all got your tickets for free in a sweepstakes.
572,Nashville Live Show,Clint, These are my people! 
573,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers and Clint laughs],
574,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Terry unlocks the voice speaker and a bell chimes and the vault door starts sliding open, and he says, "
575,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Now I’ve never actually been in the vault, cause I’m not allowed in the vault, uh, all casino employees are fitted with a security chip that prevents them from entering certain areas. Again, this job fuckin’ sucks. But you should be able to find what you’re looking for in there. Don’t worry, I’ll stand guard here and keep everyone else out."
576,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Thanks, Terry. This is for you."
577,Nashville Live Show,Travis, And I punch him.
578,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Oh my god! 
579,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I— I need to knock him out so he doesn’t get in trouble! I don’t want people to know that he was an accomplice!
580,Nashville Live Show,Clint, So you’re going to physically assault him?
581,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Yeah!
582,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I cannot—
583,Nashville Live Show,Travis, But it was only 13.
584,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, He dodges out of the way of your blow—
585,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] So maybe just a black eye? He doesn’t go unconscious. 
586,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He— you try to punch him, and you definitely do try to punch him—"
587,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I try to punch him again. 
588,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," No, hold on—"
589,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Oh, [?]"
590,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says, "
591,Nashville Live Show,Terry, I see what you’re doing.
592,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And he punches himself in the face. 
593,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Perfect, perfect. "
594,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Okay but I did get him on the third time, so he’s got two black eyes. "
595,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Okay, great! This is good! I love all of this! "
596,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I could kill him? 
597,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Jesus. "
598,Nashville Live Show,Travis, No!
599,Nashville Live Show,Justin, You probably couldn’t. 
600,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Loose lips sink ships!
601,Nashville Live Show,Justin, All right. 
602,Nashville Live Show,Travis, We are already robbing the place!
603,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The four of you start to walk into the vault and he says, "
604,Nashville Live Show,Terry," Oh my god, I almost forgot! Um, everything in Greg’s vault is cursed, so that if anyone tries to leave the premises with it, it’ll explode in a pretty terrible fashion. "
605,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, How terrible?
606,Nashville Live Show,Terry, Pretty bad. 
607,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He starts rooting around in his bag and he pulls out this, uh, small device, it almost looks like one of those metal detector wands that security personnel at like airports and big events might use? And he hands it to you, uuhh, Merle."
608,Nashville Live Show,Clint, God!
609,Nashville Live Show,Justin, God dammit. 
610,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Why did you pick Merle?? 
611,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It’s… the best. And he says, "
612,Nashville Live Show,Terry," If you touch this to anything you want to take out of here, it’ll dispel the curse. It is— Merle, "
613,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He grabs your face, "
614,Nashville Live Show,Terry," It is super important that you remember to do this, ok? I can’t take— I can’t take twenty percent of some sort of exploded treasure, okay?"
615,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Whoa, did we say twenty? "
616,Nashville Live Show,Justin, That is a fifth. 
617,Nashville Live Show,Travis, ...but did we say that? 
618,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," As you start to negotiate the details, the, uh, the vault door swings shut behind you as you hear Terry shout,"
619,Nashville Live Show,Terry, Good luck! Don’t forget about that wand! I love you!       
620,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
621,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Little fast, but all right. "
622,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And now we are flashed back, uh, to a few nights ago, uh, and she— Lup points to the blueprints again, just past the security hallway, and toward the large vault chamber on the map, and she says—"
623,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] I also— I just want to jump in— picture Barry bringing, like, a tray of hot chocolate, like, “you guys need anything?” "
624,Nashville Live Show,Barry, You guys good in— what are you guys doing in here? 
625,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Don’t worry about it, Barry!  "
626,Nashville Live Show,Travis, All right!
627,Nashville Live Show,Lup," We’re good, babe. Uh, once we make it through the security corridor, we should have access to the vault right here. Not sure why Greg made it so easily accessible, maybe dude just likes having quick access to all this ill-gotten gains, but we’ll breach the room, locate the fifteen-dollar bill, and with any luck, teleport home before we get caught! Now, listen, this is a matter of honour. We are just there for the fifteen dollar bill, nothing else. "
628,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," She says,"
629,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I’m—
630,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughter],
631,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I kind of, like— Taako kind of like puts his fists up, like, "
632,Nashville Live Show,Taako, Except…
633,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," She shakes her— she shakes her head, she says, "
634,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I’m serious. We’re not going to steal anything else while we’re in there. 
635,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And then we flashback forward to the present, and Lup says, "
636,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I’m going to steal absolutely everything in here. 
637,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughing and cheering],
638,Nashville Live Show,[Justin laughing],
639,Nashville Live Show,Taako, Yeeaahh! That’s my sister!
640,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The four— the four of you are standing in the casino’s vault, a fifteen foot wide and long room lit brightly overhead by fluorescents. In the middle of this chamber, a tall cauldron sits on the floor nearly overflowing with thousands of shiny gold coins. The walls to the east and west are lined with armaments hanging from decorative plaques, and in the back of the room is a statue of Greg Grimaldis carved out of stone. The statue is [trips over word] intricately— intricately crafted, showing Greg wearing a lavish tuxedo, and his facial features are clearly defined, and his two big wide eyes are looking down at the rest of the vault—"
641,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] So the statue’s gonna come to life, right? We can all agree the statue’s gonna…"
642,Nashville Live Show,Clint," And I’d also like to point out, Griffin, that when I did something similar in the recent arc, I had a picture—"
643,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] What the f—
644,Nashville Live Show,Clint," —that I gave everybody of the map and, you know—"
645,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, My words are my pictures! 
646,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheering],
647,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, his facial features are clearly defined, save for his two hollow eyes, which look down on the rest of the room with amusement. Sitting at the statue of Greg’s feet is a small chest. What do you do? "
648,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Tell me more about the armaments? 
649,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, they just look— they look mostly decorative, but it’s axes and swords, some of them are made of silver, uh, some of them are made of gold…"
650,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Mmmmmm….
651,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I’ll do— you know what, I’ll do, uh, an Arcana check—"
652,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] All right.
653,Nashville Live Show,Justin, —to see if I sense any magical higgledy piggledy. That’s a natural 20. What’s the scoop on magic. 
654,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah! 
655,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
656,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, with a 20—"
657,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Those dice, by the way, from ThinkGeek, and apparently, they’re weighted. "
658,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. 
659,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [simultaneously] Yeah. Go fig. 
660,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh… Everything is magical, and—"
661,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Schools of magic are probably what I would define with a 20 [crosstalk], I think I’d be getting, like, some transmutation, evocation…"
662,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, okay okay okay..."
663,Nashville Live Show,{40,50}
664,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, trap magic is [crosstalk] good—"
665,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Trap magic, yeah. I love that fuckin’ sound, dude. [crosstalk] When I get down to Ibiza, all I want is fuckin’ trap magic, baby. "
666,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of nice snares… Yeah, sure. "
667,Nashville Live Show,[Travis cackling] ,
668,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Fuckin’ blaze it, dude. Can’t get loud enough! "
669,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure. "
670,Nashville Live Show,Travis, All right. I have—
671,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Start touching things! 
672,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
673,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] No, wait! Hold on. He said trap magic. I assume you say it? "
674,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Guys, it’s trap magic. "
675,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Thank you. I want you to picture, like, a Pooh and a lotta, like, [high pitched sliding sound] whooop! "
676,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
677,Nashville Live Show,Clint," So, is this the curse he mentioned...? "
678,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You have no way of knowing what any of that is, but [crosstalk] maybe? "
679,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Well you’re here, we could just ask you. "
680,Nashville Live Show,Clint," I have— I like— I’m, like, a magic guy. "
681,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] This is true. 
682,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Are you? 
683,Nashville Live Show,Justin," All evidence to the contrary… um, I’m going to… at the chest—"
684,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yes.
685,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I want to do, um, an Investigation on the chest. "
686,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Do you know what’s amazing? 
687,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, What? [crosstalk] 
688,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] What’s amazing—
689,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, How slow we’re moving right now? How the momentum of the show—
690,Nashville Live Show,Justin, It’s a— it’s a 18. Plus… 8. 
691,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the chest is trapped, not magically, but with a wire on the inside. It’s a more physical—"
692,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Hey, this chest is trapped. Could you use your rogue—"
693,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, [high pitched] Yeeah!
694,Nashville Live Show,Taako, —perversions to—
695,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I have thief’s tools proficiency, times 2. "
696,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, so you’ll just roll, uh, a d20 and you’ll add your proficiency bonus twice to it. "
697,Nashville Live Show,Travis, 13 plus 8. 21. 
698,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s good. You get in there and you sort of slip your tools around the wire and you sort of unspool it really expertly."
699,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m doing it!
700,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, ok. And the chest— and the chest pops open, and no trap is sprung. What the— what— you’re doing the—"
701,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I’m doing the [double] six? [something] double six. <<4250>>
702,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You’re doing the Goofy Movie ultimate cast. 
703,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
704,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [sings] If we listen to each other’s hearts, find we’re never too far apart, and maybe that is the reason why for the first time ever we’re seeing it eye to eye! God, I love that movie! "
705,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
706,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Within—
707,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [singing] For the first time—
708,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Within the chest— please stop— within the chest, you see a red cushion housing a circle of gemstones. Arranged in that pattern are a pair of the following emeralds—"
709,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I dropped one of my die.
710,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," —emeralds, opaz— opaz? [crosstalk] Opaz is nothing. "
711,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Opazes? 
712,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Opaz! A cross between opal and topaz!
713,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Guys this one’s really rare, I’ve never even heard of this one, we gotta steal it first! "
714,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Emeralds, o— emeralds, opals, topazes, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies. "
715,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Dapphires. Tubies. 
716,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [laughing] Tubies! Oh my god, there’s beautiful tubies in here!"
717,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Do you see how the clock says three minutes on it? And you’re—
718,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I actually don’t have visibility on the clock. 
719,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay, it’s—"
720,Nashville Live Show,Justin, What is it now? 
721,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Holy shit. Emeralds, opals, topazes, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies. "
722,Nashville Live Show,Justin, It’s the order—
723,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Okay there’s a puzzle here, we have to get the—"
724,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, what’s the order— is the order of those important? Is it alphabe— okay, let’s talk about the—"
725,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, There is an order. 
726,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Diamonds, rubies—"
727,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay, yes, go. "
728,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Dr. Pepper. Diamonds, rubies. Topaz. "
729,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Okay, what about the chemical composition of diamonds and rubies?"
730,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Emerald. 
731,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Diamonds, rubies, topaz. D, R—"
732,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Donut. 
733,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] D, R—"
734,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] What if it’s Ruby Tuesday— Ruby Tuesdays...
735,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] My— my rambunctious mother—
736,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I don’t— I think you missed this part too, there’s two of each of them. "
737,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Okay. 
738,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Okay. Diamond, diamond, topaz, topaz, opal, opaz, topaz, diamond, diamond, tymond, [starts speaking gibberish]. "
739,Nashville Live Show,Justin," So that’s diamond, topaz, emerald, ruby, [crosstalk] hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers and balloons…"
740,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Diamond, topaz, emerald, ruby..."
741,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Just give me the stones one more time, Griff. [crosstalk] Give me the stones!"
742,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Emeralds. Emeralds—
743,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Wait! E… 
744,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [exasperated] Oh, it’s not the letters! "
745,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Wait a minute! It’s colours!
746,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Opals, topaz—"
747,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Green, orange, purple—"
748,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Sapphires, diamonds, and rubies. "
749,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Striped. 
750,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Diamonds don’t really fit into, like, a—"
751,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Plaid. 
752,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Diamonds don’t fit into, like, a rainbow kind of thing. A prismatic situation. "
753,Nashville Live Show,Travis, It’s the Mohs Hardness Scale!
754,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [talking loudly over Travis] Because you take so long in the rooooom—
755,Nashville Live Show,Travis, It’s the Mohs Hardness Scale! 
756,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Just, an alarm sounds, because you’ve been in here for so long without solving the trap, and—"
757,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I grab all of the stones and put them in my bag. 
758,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
759,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I disarmed the trap! 
760,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, it doesn’t matter, this is a time alarm, because the three of you aaaaare dipshiiiiits! "
761,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Quick! Merle, Merle, use the wand on my bag, quick! "
762,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Quick! I use the wand in his bag and immediately—
763,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Wooop! Moving on. 
764,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the alarm does shut off, but you assume that to actually be Terry’s doing?"
765,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Nice.
766,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," Sick, Terry!"
767,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," —but the, uh— The magical trap has been sprung and gold has begun pouring out of the cauldron in the center of the room, clattering to the ground below, almost as if it’s multiplying rapidly, threatening to flood the room that you’re standing in. It’s up to your ankles. Uh, what do you do? Also the chest, uh— I’ll give you this because we gotta move on, uh, the chest has an arrow pointing upwards to the statue of Greg Grimaldis. "
768,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Does Greg have these gems somewhere on him? 
769,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He does not. Greg Grimaldis, a statue carved of stone, the statue is intricately crafted showing Greg wearing a lavish tuxedo and his facial features are clearly defined, save for his two hollow eyes, which look down at the rest of the vault—"
770,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Ooohkay.
771,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Blue! Sapphires! Put sapphires in his eyes!
772,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Put the sapphires in his eyes! 
773,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Put the— we put the sapphires in there! 
774,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Put sapphires in his eyes! Yeah!
775,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Sapphires in his eyes, alright."
776,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
777,Nashville Live Show,Clint," That’s mine! That’s mine! Yeah, I got it first."
778,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Yeah, Clint solved it everybody."
779,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Sapphires in his eyes.
780,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Gold reaches up to your knees as you place the sapphires into the statue’s eyes, and it raises up out of the floor, displacing a pile of gold as it lifts up. And underneath it you see what looks like an elevator car attached to the bottom of a statue."
781,Nashville Live Show,[various whoops from audience members],
782,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The doors— yeah, elevators, fuck yeah— the doors of the car—"
783,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
784,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I use the pocket workshop to get a bunch of gold in there.
785,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, okay, you scoop some gold into the pocket workshop—"
786,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Like a lot. I put it over the, the cauldron as it just..."
787,Nashville Live Show,{46,55}
788,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the doors of the car open up, allowing a few hundred gold coins to spill inside, allowing you access to the car. Uh, and as it—"
789,Nashville Live Show,Travis, How much gold do you think is in the pocket workshop? 
790,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Three thousand gold pieces.
791,Nashville Live Show,Travis, That’s a lot of gold!
792,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Lup—
793,Nashville Live Show,Justin, That’s nice. 
794,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Lup says, "
795,Nashville Live Show,Lup," I’m guessing this is some sort of decoy vault. Grimaldis, you slippery shit! Well, we’re already in it, you know, I say we keep pushing on! "
796,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And she walks over to the elevator car. 
797,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Yeah, let’s do it, are you kidding me? "
798,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Yeah! We’ve only got— oh, negative 46 seconds! "
799,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh-oh! The four of you step into the elevator car and the glass door back into the vault closes in front of you. And just as you see the gold, uh, just as you see the door back into the hallway, you hear people starting to pound at it. The -elevator moves. Uh, also, inside the gold that’s on the floor, you see a golden shark fin pop up and start to swim towards you. That was just a cool part of this trap that I thought was gonna get sprung earlier, but I didn’t get to use it. But right as the shark is about to reach you, this cool gold shark— it was gonna, like, pull you in under the gold, and it was gonna be a fun thing, but [crosstalk] it didn’t happen. "
800,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] So so far in McElroy canon, glass shark, gold shark. "
801,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, we’re doing all the sharks. [audience cheers] This elevator cart doesn’t move down, the floor simply disappears beneath your feet, and you’re all falling with a shower of golden coins close behind— don’t. I know I said…"
802,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
803,Nashville Live Show,Clint, So it’s golden...
804,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Nooope ba ba bap! 
805,Nashville Live Show,Travis, What?? 
806,Nashville Live Show,Clint, And it’s a shower…
807,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Look at the timer! This is not something my Dad should know about! 
808,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Griffin got there first! 
809,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] What— what you fear to be a deadly trap quickly reveals itself to be something more innocuous. You’re on a long, golden slide, spiraling downwards through rings of silvery light, it’s actually pretty fun. And your trip ends as you—"
810,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Is there, like, Sonic music playing? "
811,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yes. [sings a tune] Dat da da da da, and you’re sliding through the, the last ring of light, and now the four of you are falling into this enormous room, five times the size of the decoy vault you were just in. And after falling 20 feet or so off the end of the slide, your landing is cushioned by a huge pile of paper. But not just any paper— beneath you, and piled up against the walls of this room in these tall slopes, are mountains of fifteen dollar bills."
812,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Oh, fuck."
813,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," These piles lead downward to the center of the room, where the bills have been swept away into a circular clearing, and in the center of that clearing is a large, ten foot tall slot machine. It looks much older than the others you saw in the gaming pit. It’s made of ornate wood and heavy iron plating. And Lup, when you crash down into the money, she says, "
814,Nashville Live Show,Lup," We’re close, but I don’t think any of these are the original. We have to find the first fifteen dollar bill if we want to shut down this whole operation. "
815,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And she slides— she sleds down the, uh the cash pile towards the slot machine [crosstalk] in the center of the room. "
816,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Ooh, paper cuts! [sucks breath in]"
817,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I’m just gonna go turbo speed now— as the four of you approach the giant ancient slot machine, Lup turns towards the rest of you, and she says, "
818,Nashville Live Show,Lup, Anyone else want to handle this? I’m not feeling particularly lucky today. 
819,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Yeah, I don’t know who the—"
820,Nashville Live Show,Merle, I’ll do it! 
821,Nashville Live Show,Taako, All right. 
822,Nashville Live Show,Magnus," [crosstalk] I don’t think we’re, uh—"
823,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] All right, Merle. "
824,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Yeah, Merle does it!"
825,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Merle, you walk up and pull the lever of the slot machine [Clint Yeah!] and the three wheels inside start spinning, showing colourful flashes of cherries, sevens, gold coins, and fifteen-dollar bills, and it starts chiming out this high— high pitched sound, like this tinkling noise, and then the wheels come to a sudden stop, and three symbols align on the display skulls. "
826,Nashville Live Show,"And a window slides open above the slots, and a light flickers on inside that window, and you see a face with jet black hair and sideburns, and a wide grin punctuated with one gold tooth and two bright blue eyes. And seeing this face inside the slot machine, Lup gasps and you hear the voice of Greg Grimaldis boom throughout the vault— what did he fuckin’ sound— he sound—",
827,Nashville Live Show,Justin," He’s like a heavy New York— [crosstalk] Yeah, kind of—"
828,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [imitating Greg’s voice] [crosstalk] Heeyy, I see—"
829,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [imitating Greg’s voice] [crosstalk] Heeyy!
830,Nashville Live Show,Greg Grimaldis," [crosstalk] You didn’t think it was gonna be that easy, didja? "
831,Nashville Live Show,Merle, Yeah? 
832,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And the slot machine starts lifting up slowly from the ground as two thick wooden legs sprout from its base, and two long arms and a mechanical head sprout from its top. And while this slot machine transforms into this imposing figure, Greg speaks and says, "
833,Nashville Live Show,Greg Grimaldis," You didn’t think I knew you’d be back someday, Lup? You didn’t think I’d know the second you crossed the threshold of this casino? You and your brother, you’ve always been too proud, and you know what they say about pride. Like… what it comes before. "
834,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And Lup—
835,Nashville Live Show,Merle, In the dictionary? 
836,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And Lup— [chuckles] and Lup smirks and her hands catch fire, and she says, "
837,Nashville Live Show,Lup, You know what? I take it back. 
838,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And she turns towards Greg and she says, "
839,Nashville Live Show,Lup, I am feeling lucky. 
840,Nashville Live Show,{51,31}
841,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
842,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," We’re gonna take an intermission now so we can all go use the bathroooom, and we’ll be back!"
843,Nashville Live Show,Travis, There are posters out the in the lobby!
844,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," There’s posters out in the lobby, and also bathrooms everywhere, not everywhere, they’re where the bathrooms are."

848,Nashville Live Show,{51,"55-5714, Commercial Break}"
849,Nashville Live Show,Justin, —weave this tapestry...
850,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Let’s roooooollllllllll initiative!
851,Nashville Live Show,Justin," There we go. [audience cheers, dice hits table] That’s a nine for Hoops."
852,Nashville Live Show,Travis, That issss…. seventeen.
853,Nashville Live Show,"[dice hits table, Clint laughs maniacally]",
854,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Well that’s not— that’s not actually that helpful because that just means you have to take the initiative first. You didn’t actually do—
855,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I rolled a twenty! Give me a little freakin’ credit!
856,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay. Okay.
857,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
858,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Merle goes first. Merle, you are standing in front of this, uh, ten-foot-tall slot machine, sort of, mech, with Greg Grimaldis inside of it. What do you do?"
859,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I cast Guardian of Faith!
860,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
861,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Oldie but a goodie. What’s that one do?
862,Nashville Live Show,Clint, That creates a giant Della Reese!
863,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Sure.
864,Nashville Live Show,Clint," And Giant Della Reese— any creature that’s hostile, is hostile to you, that moves to a space within 10 feet of us for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw."
865,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Gotcha.
866,Nashville Live Show,Clint, So she just stands there.
867,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] She just stands there.
868,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Yeah. Just stands there lookin’, and she’s got this look on her face. [makes a face at the audience]"
869,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okaayyyy.
870,Nashville Live Show,Justin, It’s an audio podcast.
871,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Greg Grimaldis is up next. Uh, and, I guess he’s gonna roll a Dexterity saving throw. [dice hits table] Uh, that is an 11, which is not gonna beat your spellcasting modifier. [Clint Nope!] So roll that beautiful Bean footage."
872,Nashville Live Show,Clint, The creature takes twenty radiant damage!
873,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Oh! Okay.
874,Nashville Live Show,Clint, On a failed save!
875,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," That’s what that was, so, good!"
876,Nashville Live Show,[Justin & audience laugh],
877,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The slot machine robot rears up one of its arms and pulls the lever, and, uh, the slots start spinning… and it lands on three fifteen-dollar bills. Uh, and, when that happens, this big pile that’s just all around the room, pressed up against the walls of this room, you see a shape start to take form inside of this cache. And this big face with two hands emerges, this twenty-foot-tall face of money with these two big money hands, uh, takes shape. And the money monster— another classic— it’s just George Clooney fest up in here!— uh, will act next, and is going to slam one of those big fists down on Taakooo."
878,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Come on…
879,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Taakoooo… that is a nineteen versus AC.
880,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Mmmthat’s gonna do it.
881,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Um, as a protection fighter, disadvantage, re-roll that shiiit!"
882,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
883,Nashville Live Show,{59,44}
884,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
885,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, That is a fifteen versus AC.
886,Nashville Live Show,Justin, That’s still gonna do it.
887,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okayyy…
888,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] I’m dressed in rags, my skin is-"
889,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Remind me to get you a better hat!
890,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay.
891,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, that is 21 points of money damaaaaage… [Justin Ooh…] As it slams a big money-fist down on you… That is-"
892,Nashville Live Show,Justin," It’s, uh…"
893,Nashville Live Show,[audience member, “Cash money!”]
894,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, That is— it is money. Next in the order is Magnus. 
895,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Um… So. First, tell me more about these wooden legs. Are they tree-like?"
896,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
897,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," ...they were formerly trees, yes."
898,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Yeahhhhhh! Okay, that is a… twenty-four."
899,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [resigned] Shit.
900,Nashville Live Show,[pause],
901,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I rolled a fourteen, I get plus TEN!"
902,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
903,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I only do one thing! Um, and then that is… uh, nine plus five, fourteen points of damage, and I cleave a leg in half."
904,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, I think one of the legs is just gone, and, uh-"
905,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Okay!
906,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Nice!
907,Nashville Live Show,Travis, And then with my second attack… 
908,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I can bet, I can guess..."
909,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna attack the money monster with my Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
910,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Oh shit.
911,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
912,Nashville Live Show,Clint, And?
913,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, one— one small, uh, note… [dramatic pause] MY Flaming [crosstalk] Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom."
914,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Yeah. I’m going to attack—
915,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] That I do let you use.
916,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I’m going to attack the money monster with Taako’s—
917,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Flaming—
918,Nashville Live Show,Justin," From the Taako Library. It’s got the stamp on it, it says ‘Please Return to, if you die again’—"
919,Nashville Live Show,Clint, ‘Stolen From’—
920,Nashville Live Show,[dice roll],
921,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It did not go through the dice tower, it does not count!"
922,Nashville Live Show,[dice rolls again],
923,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Okay great, because that was aaaaaaa… twenty-nine—"
924,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yes!
925,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Um, so that’s [mumbled] one d8… [dice rolls] that was 2, plus 24, so 26 points of damage! And I assume, because it’s money, and it’s fire—"
926,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah it’s actually 52 points of damage, um—"
927,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Ayyyy...
928,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Yeahhh…
929,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
930,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, As you swipe— [crosstalk]
931,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] A very good sword, Connor, a very good sword."
932,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Connor? Not— Colin!
933,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Aww, Colin!"
934,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Colin is here tonight! The kid that created—
935,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Colin, are you here?"
936,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Thank you, Colin, you crushed it with this very good sword."
937,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Colin—
938,Nashville Live Show,Clint," If you see a kid dressed like Angus going [crosstalk] ‘yeah, I made that’—"
939,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s not gonna narrow it down. Colin? Where are you, Colin? Colin? We’re pointing up, can we get some house lights for a second?"
940,Nashville Live Show,Clint, House lights?
941,Nashville Live Show,Justin, House lights pleeeaaassseeee??
942,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Are we putting Colin on blast right now? 
943,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Where i—
944,Nashville Live Show,[Colin’s father holds him up],
945,Nashville Live Show,{62,14}

948,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Oh, god!"
949,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Jesus!
950,Nashville Live Show,Justin, The end. Jesus.
951,Nashville Live Show,Clint," You went all Michael Jackson on him there, dangling him over the edge!"
952,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Put— put Blanket down…
953,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay.
954,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Alright.
955,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Alright.
956,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Alright, fifty-two points of damage, thank you Colin— [crosstalk]"
957,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Thank you, Colin, thank you."
958,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Colin, these are your 52 points of damage, that—"
959,Nashville Live Show,Justin," That you gave to me, and I loaned to him."
960,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and you see this big, flaming streak go up the money monster’s chest, and it roars as it takes this huge hit, and then the fire starts to spread throughout the money surrounding the room. "
961,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Uh ohhhhh…
962,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
963,Nashville Live Show,Travis, That’s Taako’s fire!
964,Nashville Live Show,[Clint & audience laugh],
965,Nashville Live Show,{63,12}
966,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Next in the order is Taako! Taako, you have a one-legged, slightly damaged, uh, slot machine in front of you and a, uh, uh, money monster who is on fire and sort of flailing around, and also the room’s catching on fire. Pretty good heist."
967,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Where am I? [nervous laugh] Where am I in relation to the money monster?
968,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you’re— the, the slot machine monster’s, like, between you and them. You’re about 30 feet away from them, I’d say."
969,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okayyy… well, I’ll run around him…"
970,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, ‘Kay.
971,Nashville Live Show,Justin, And over to the money monster.
972,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I’m gonna do an attack of opportunity on you. [pause] It’s fine, it’s just some damage."
973,Nashville Live Show,[Justin laughs],
974,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, that’s a seventeen versus AC? "
975,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Yeah, how much damage would you like to give me?"
976,Nashville Live Show,[dice rolls],
977,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Seventeen points of damage!
978,Nashville Live Show,Justin," That’s a very good amount of damage, thank you."
979,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
980,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Don’t worry, canonically, I can’t die."
981,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
982,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Actually, we’re after the events of the recorded Adventure Zone, so—"
983,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [high pitched] But he was at Magnus’s bedside [crosstalk] when Magnus died.
984,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Oh, shit. [crosstalk] Spoilers, shut up!"
985,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
986,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay.
987,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Jesus!
988,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Magnus is mortal— 
989,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] You do have a rather accomplished healer in your party…
990,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Of course.
991,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [blows raspberry] Who, Lup?"
992,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Well, ok, now— now I’m nervous. Um, alright, but I’m gonna get over there and I am gonna cast Wall of Ice to create a hemispheric dome, um, with a radius of 10 feet, um, made of ice, um, around— near myself, the money monster, and the fire to try to put that situation out."
993,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Are you trying to capture yourself in this ice… sphere?
994,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Noooo…
995,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Nooo, I didnt think... Okay."
996,Nashville Live Show,Justin," No, Griffin, that would be… ill-advised, I think. [Griffin Okay.] Uh, I think what I’m going to do as a sentient being that wants to preserve its own life— [Griffin laughs] And wants to preserve canon, frankly, will cast that in a 10-foot sphere centered on the money monster. "
997,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay!
998,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, so, this… "
999,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Do you just do it?
1000,Nashville Live Show,{65,03}
1001,Nashville Live Show,Justin," ‘Scuse me? Gonna make a Dexterity saving throw, and on a failed save you will take some amount of damage. "
1002,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
1003,Nashville Live Show,[dice rolls],
1004,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I’m… very sorry [laughs], uh, I did roll a nineteen, plus four, a twenty-three."
1005,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, that’s higher than my modifier."
1006,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Sure.
1007,Nashville Live Show,Justin, So…
1008,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] It’ll take some damage though!
1009,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] We’ll edit this point out, roll again."
1010,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," No, it’ll take some damage!"
1011,Nashville Live Show,Justin," No wait, yeah, you’re gonna take… 5d6 damage."
1012,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, [whispered] Oh fuck.
1013,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Six… ten… eleven… fourteen… seventeen.
1014,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
1015,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Some?
1016,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s very good. Uh, the money monster looks very bad. You create this Wall of Ice, but it leaps over it, and, and takes some damage from, like, the jagged icicle shards on top of it, uh, that, that scrape into it. Uh, and it lands in front of you, separated now from the big money pile, so it is sort of… separated from its… life force, I guess? Uh, but the, uh, the fire is still starting to spread around the money in the room, uh, creating a— some, some smoke that is now pouring up to the ceiling."
1017,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Okay.
1018,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, next up is Lup, who says—"
1019,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
1020,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, She— she says—
1021,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Oh, does… does everyone like Lup?"
1022,Nashville Live Show,"[Griffin laughs, audience cheers]",
1023,Nashville Live Show,Clint, More than us?
1024,Nashville Live Show,[audience member, “Yeah…”]
1025,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
1026,Nashville Live Show,"[Travis laughs, audience cheers]",
1027,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, She says—
1028,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Security!
1029,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, She says
1030,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Well, uh, if it’s already on fire..."
1031,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And she casts Flame Blade. Uh, you evoke a fiery blade in your free hand, the blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar and lasts for the duration, uh—"
1032,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I want you to picture Magnus going
1033,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Ey! Ey! You! Ah! [sounds of protestation]
1034,Nashville Live Show,Lup, Same hat! Same hat!
1035,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
1036,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, she stabs the Flame Blade into the money monster and pulls it up, uh, and hits it forrrr… uh, eighteen, which is thirty-six points of fire damage. The—"
1037,Nashville Live Show,{67,00}
1038,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [mocking] Ooooh!
1039,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And the money monster is cut in half, and half of it just burns away in the smoke and now it’s just half— it’s, uh, kind of a—"
1040,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Now it’s seven fifty.
1041,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, It’s a much smaller— it’s a much smaller money monster.
1042,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Now it’s made of euros.
1043,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Euros are actually doing better than the dollar.
1044,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Oh really, is it?"
1045,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Oh, I don’t know."
1046,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Next in the order is— next in the order is Merle Highchurch. This has been our… finance shooooowww? ‘What is Money?’
1047,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Mass Healing Word.
1048,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
1049,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I’m gonna— wait a minute—
1050,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Has anybody [crosstalk] taken damage?
1051,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Only Taako’s been hurt!
1052,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Well then I think it’s appropriate that I would waste this spell on just that. [audience laughs] Maybe I shouldn’t.
1053,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," No, go for it! Do what you want!"
1054,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I’ll cast Mass Healing Word.
1055,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
1056,Nashville Live Show,Clint," As I call out words of restoration - ‘Go, team, go!’ - um—"
1057,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Very good.
1058,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4—
1059,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The money monster looks at you pleadingly, like [makes puppy eyes, audience laughs]"
1060,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Awww… [crosstalk] Aww, wow…"
1061,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] It can’t talk, but it’s like [mimics threatening to cry]"
1062,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Aww… 
1063,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Don’t.
1064,Nashville Live Show,Clint, No. No. I guess I d— do I have to specify? I guess I—
1065,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, ‘Just the good guys! The good— the good part of the team! The— the—’ your friends.
1066,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Yeah, just the good pe— part of my team. "
1067,Nashville Live Show,[rolls dice],
1068,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, That’s the tiniest dice.
1069,Nashville Live Show,Clint," How do you— oh, two, plus my spell modifier."
1070,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Which is eight. [audience member “Ten!”] Thank you, ten."
1071,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Hey!
1072,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Everybody is healed for ten points of damage.
1073,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Ok, Magnus feels exactly the same."
1074,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I appreciate that, [crosstalk] thank you."
1075,Nashville Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] And I don’t guess a ‘thank you’, would kill ya, would it?"
1076,Nashville Live Show,Taako, Tha— thanks! Thanks for the fuckin’ Ludens.
1077,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin laughs],
1078,Nashville Live Show,Taako," Ten whole points, you shouldn’t have! My migraine disappeared!"
1079,Nashville Live Show,[Clint laughs],
1080,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, up next is Greg Grimaldis, and the wheels spiiiiin, and he gets… all sevens, uh, across the dial."
1081,Nashville Live Show,Taako, Hooray!
1082,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And, Magnus, uh, the, the slot-machine-bot points a fist at you, and a rocket punch comes flying [crosstalk] at you—"
1083,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I point a fist back and punch back!
1084,Nashville Live Show,"[audience cheers, dice rolls]",
1085,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Uh… that is a 26 versus AC.
1086,Nashville Live Show,Travis, That’s a Nat 1.
1087,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You can’t fuckin’ punch during my punch!
1088,Nashville Live Show,{69,39}
1089,Nashville Live Show,Travis, It was a Nat 1.
1090,Nashville Live Show,Clint, It was a Nat 1.
1091,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay. Uh, 26 v AC?"
1092,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [sad noises] Yeah...
1093,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It’s a fuckin’ hit, uh—"
1094,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
1095,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," With its, uh, seventh attack, it punches you for seventy-seven points of damage."
1096,Nashville Live Show,[audience recoils],
1097,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I am going to use— hold on— I am gonna use parry—
1098,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay. [gruff voice] ‘Hey, it’s Perry, what did you need?’"
1099,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [gruff voice] ‘Oh shit! Ow!’

1102,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [gruff voice] ‘Hey listen,—’"
1103,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna reduce it by eight. [chuckles]
1104,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay. [audience laughs] [realizing the math] Oh! NICE!
1105,Nashville Live Show,[audience erupts],

1175,Nashville Live Show,[dice rolls],
1176,Nashville Live Show,Travis," There we go. That’s a fourteen, plus ten is twenty-four."
1177,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yes. On the money monster?
1178,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Yes. 
1179,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It had one hit point left. It just ex— it— it was one, single dollar bill just like [singing] ‘I’m just a bill, yes— oh, fuck!’"
1180,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
1181,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," The money monster is vanquished, but the fire, uh, on the outside walls of the room, is like— it’s taken up, like, half the room, and [crosstalk] it’s getting hot in here."
1182,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] And with my extra attack, my Action Surge, I get an extra attack?"
1183,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yes.
1184,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Okay.

1186,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Don’t help him!
1187,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I’m going to throw my Chance Lance to wedge one of the wheels in place.
1188,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," There’s no wheels. Oh! Ok, ok, there are wheels."
1189,Nashville Live Show,Travis," Fifteen plus ten, twenty-five."

1195,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You— [laughs] Uh, alright. Uh—"
1196,Nashville Live Show,Justin," I didn’t think it would make it back to me, I thought you would all have this… sorted out. I think, I’ll, uh… [audience member “Fireball!”] Uh, Fireball."
1197,Nashville Live Show,[Griffin and audience laugh],
1198,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I did have that pulled up.
1199,Nashville Live Show,Travis," But also, don’t help, but… thank you."
1200,Nashville Live Show,Justin," That was what I was gonna do, I mean, it’s a big wood thing, it’s almost dead, I’ll just go ahead and throw a fireball at it. Dexterity saving throw."
1201,Nashville Live Show,[dice rolls],
1202,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, No!

1208,Nashville Live Show,Justin,"  Yeah, [crosstalk] please do."
1209,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] You always do.
1210,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," As you start to channel this Fireball, you feel Lup up against your back, and you feel her actually conjuring a Fireball at the same time, as the two of you, fuckin’, Jessie-and-James-from-Pokémon-style… throw two Fireballs at the slot machine monster that spiral around each other and slam into it at the same time— [crosstalk]"
1211,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] It’s like, one’s blue and one’s red, and it’s like—"
1212,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] —yeah yeah yeah, hitting it for thirty-eight points of damage."
1213,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Nice!
1214,Nashville Live Show,[audience cheers],
1215,Nashville Live Show,{74,51}
1216,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It is… still up, but it looks really bad off, and also it’s a little bit on fire, so you hear Greg Grimaldis inside, going like"
1217,Nashville Live Show,Greg," OH! Aww, beans!"
1218,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Also, this room is now completely on fire. The walls of this room are just surrounded by flame, and it’s actually— all of you make a Constitution saving throw, [crosstalk] as you are choking down smoke."
1219,Nashville Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Not my strong suit…
1220,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Is that dangerous?
1221,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Seventeen…
1222,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Hey, everybody, this is a PSA! Fire smoke, super-duper dangerous, and—"

1230,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Back up to the top of the order, [crosstalk] as he breathes—"
1231,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] [heavy inhale sounds] It’s delicious!
1232,Nashville Live Show,{75,38}
1233,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You do vape tricks with the smoke.
1234,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
1235,Nashville Live Show,Travis, COTTON!
1236,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yes. Yes, cotton. Cotton indeed."
1237,Nashville Live Show,Travis," [laughing] Cotton, indeed!"
1238,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, next in the order is Merle Highchurch."

1240,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Oh, God."
1241,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
1242,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Go with this. I ask Greg,"
1243,Nashville Live Show,Merle, Which one is the real fifteen-dollar bill?
1244,Nashville Live Show,Clint, And I cast ZONE OF TRUTH! [audience applauds] So it doesn’t burn up!
1245,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Y’all. No joke. This is the most proud I’ve ever been of my dad.
1246,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, very good."
1247,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Not because he used it well! But because he found a justifiable way to use it at all.
1248,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
1249,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Uh—
1250,Nashville Live Show,Clint, [pretending to cry] Thank you very much!
1251,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I love you, Daddy."
1252,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," I rolled— I rolled a seven, and— Greg Grimaldis says,"
1253,Nashville Live Show,Greg," Yeah, I got it in here. It’s in here, with me, in this locket around my neck."
1254,Nashville Live Show,Merle," Well, Greg, if you want us to save ya, you gotta give it to us!"
1255,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, I like that."
1256,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, He says—
1257,Nashville Live Show,Clint," I mean, I’m sorry,"
1258,Nashville Live Show,Merle," Greg, if you want us to save ya—"
1259,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Thank you.
1260,Nashville Live Show,Merle, Ya gotta give it to us!
1261,Nashville Live Show,Travis," And remember, Griffin, you are in his Zone of Truth."
1262,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
1263,Nashville Live Show,Greg," No, I think I’m just gonna punch you right now."
1264,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, And then he punches you right now. He’s telling the truth!
1265,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I thought— I thought we burned his arms off!
1266,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You burned his legs— you cut his legs off…
1267,Nashville Live Show,Clint, How’s he gonna reach me?
1268,Nashville Live Show,Travis, He’s got big arms.
1269,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I dodge.
1270,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
1271,Nashville Live Show,Clint, I weave.
1272,Nashville Live Show,Justin, I step back.
1273,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Uh… that is only a nine versus AC.
1274,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Noooooo, I’m sorry, that doesn’t hurt me at all."
1275,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Okay, he tries to punch you and fails very badly. He says"
1276,Nashville Live Show,Greg, I feel em— I feel embarrassed in front of all of you. 
1277,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
1278,Nashville Live Show,Greg," I don’t like how on-fire my casino is right now. [pause] I liked the ending of Lost, I don’t—"
1279,Nashville Live Show,[McEl-boys & audience laugh],
1280,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I attack Greg.
1281,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay! It is your turn.
1282,Nashville Live Show,Travis, With the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
1283,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Okay!
1284,Nashville Live Show,Justin," You’re gonna kill him then, okay."
1285,Nashville Live Show,Travis, That is—
1286,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Aww!
1287,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Eighteen plus ten.
1288,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yes.
1289,Nashville Live Show,Travis," That is… thirty-six. [all laugh] Um— that was a joke. Cuz it was bad math. Um, let’s see… [dice roll] But no one laughed so it’s not a joke."
1290,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Colin—
1291,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Stop referencing—
1292,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Colin, bad math is not a joke."
1293,Nashville Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] That’s not how a joke works.
1294,Nashville Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] There’s— there’s nothing funny about bad math, Colin."
1295,Nashville Live Show,Travis," That is a nine, plus twenty-four, thirty-three points of damage."
1296,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," It explodes. Uh, the slot machine robot, you just stab into it and ten more springs shoot out of it and you see Greg’s face illuminated from underneath like"
1297,Nashville Live Show,Greg, [fear noises]
1298,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And it explodes, which sends Greg tumbling down hard to the floor, his cape still sort of on fire."
1299,Nashville Live Show,Travis," You know what’s interesting? It just occurred to me. I’ve used the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom many times, never dealt with Poison damage."
1300,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Yeah…
1301,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Huh.
1302,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Huh.
1303,Nashville Live Show,Travis," It’s not funny, really, so much as it’s just… bad gameplay."
1304,Nashville Live Show,{78,44}
1305,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, sure. Uh, Greg tumbles down hard to the floor several feet away from your party as this room is just in a big blaze. Uh, and as he falls, a large locket slips off his neck and skids to a halt at your feet. And, surveying the scene around him, Greg says"
1306,Nashville Live Show,Greg," Okay, fine, the fifteen-dollar bill is in that locket, just please don’t kill me! I’ll be good from now on, I promise!"
1307,Nashville Live Show,[audience member, “Finish him!”]
1308,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, Holy shit!
1309,Nashville Live Show,Travis, Greg has a fake family!
1310,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, a chime rings from your belts, indicating that your time in this world is nearly through. What do you do?"
1311,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Please!
1312,Nashville Live Show,[audience members, “Lup!”]
1313,Nashville Live Show,Magnus, Lup?
1314,Nashville Live Show,Justin, What?
1315,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Lup starts to catch fire with her hands, and she says "
1316,Nashville Live Show,Lup," No, we burn down his casino, as long as we take away his money power, I don’t— we don’t gotta murder him."
1317,Nashville Live Show,Travis, I cut off his ear.
1318,Nashville Live Show,Lup, HOLY SHIT!
1319,Nashville Live Show,[audience laughs],
1320,Nashville Live Show,Lup," Okay, that one’s actually good."
1321,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Uh, don’t forget to do the thing."
1322,Nashville Live Show,Clint," Oh! I use the, the, the—"
1323,Nashville Live Show,Justin, Wand.
1324,Nashville Live Show,Clint, Wand of de-curse-uration—
1325,Nashville Live Show,Justin," De-curse-uration, yes."
1326,Nashville Live Show,Clint, And I remove the curse from… something.
1327,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, You— you pick up the locket. Lup says
1328,Nashville Live Show,Lup, Mission accomplished! And just in time!
1329,Nashville Live Show,Griffin, All of you are starting to—
1330,Nashville Live Show,Travis," I toss him his ear back. I don’t want it, it’s gross."
1331,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," All of you are starting to sort of get spirited away back to your home, and Merle, you take this wand and tap it to the locket, and the wand glows green for just a moment, and when that light fades, you can see, just as you’re about to be pulled away, that—"
1332,Nashville Live Show,Clint," There’s no place like home, there’s no place like home…"
1333,Nashville Live Show,Justin," Okay, we’re gonna go ahead and let Griffin— go ahead."
1334,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," You can see that your hands are empty. [audience reacts] And Lup, seeing this, says"
1335,Nashville Live Show,        Lup, SON OF A—
1336,Nashville Live Show,Griffin," And then all of you are teleported away. [music] And then we see the front of the Grand Grimaldis Casino, fire alarms are blaring and fancily-dressed folks are running out the doors, trying to get to safety, and the casino security personnel are evacuating, too, and we see one of those security crew members, a young man with bushy red hair make a beeline for the crowd of visitors, disappearing into the mass. And then he reappears on the other side, only now he is not wearing a security uniform anymore. You see Terry walking confidently away from the casino in a sharp black tuxedo, and in front of him, a green light begins to materialize, and he smiles and reaches into the light, and he retrieves the prize you just teleported right into his hands a wrinkled fifteen-dollar bill. And he delicately folds it and places it into his breast pocket, and, turning away from the flaming casino, he looks directly into the camera."
1337,Nashville Live Show,And he winks.,
1338,Nashville Live Show,"That is the end of our adventure, thank you so much for coming! Goodbye!",
