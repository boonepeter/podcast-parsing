7,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Announcer," What’s up San Diego? It’s me, the weird voice. Since we’re at Comic Con I feel like I can finally say, I’ve been Batman the whole time. Swear to me! "
8,SDCC San Diego Live Show,It’s the Adventure Zone!,
9,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[THEME MUSIC," ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson (full song on YouTube(fixed))]"
10,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers wildly],
11,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s like three minutes of show you don’t get. Oh wait! Magic potion. [noise like cup hitting table] Umm.
12,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Jesus, I’ve got a timer. We— are so fucking bad at timing out this show and we always have to like, spoiler alert the last ten minutes are gonna be like “uhh and then the boss shows up and you kill him he’s dead!”"
13,SDCC San Diego Live Show,I got a timer here and it’s actually I just realized the most stressful imaginable object.,
14,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"Hi everybody, welcome to The Adventure Zone! Thank you for coming!",
15,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Uh, I would like to go ahead and get it out of the way, can we get house lights for like just a minute [crosstalk] to see all the awesome cosplays?"

17,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"If you’re cos— Jesus, god. Oh man, alright.",

19,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah."
20,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Wait a minute, I’m gonna sketch you all! Hold on."
21,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It’s awesome. And you can just leave a check for a portion of the rights to those…unlicensed…
22,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, let’s play Dungeons and Dragons. I wanna really spend some time playing this one and not [crosstalk]"
23,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s actually play Dungeons and Dragons."
24,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Real quick introductions I’m Griffin McElroy and I’m gonna be the Dungeon Master. [cheering] Thank you thank you thank you.
25,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, hold on. Is there anyone here who doesn’t know the show? ‘Cause it’s about to get real weird for you. "
26,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, my name is Justin McElroy, I’m Taako Taaco, a wizard."
27,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[cheering],
28,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I play Magnus Burnsides, the rustically hospitable fighter."
29,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[cheering],
30,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," And I play Merle Highchurch, the incredibly...uh...talented and gifted  Dungeons and Dragons player."
31,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[cheering],
32,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Don’t get too close.
33,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Was I too close?
34,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," My dad, who’s been a radio professional for the last 120 years, and—"
35,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And he eats that microphone like it is a doughnut! 
36,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Whaat? There’re doughnuts?
37,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Let’s, get into it. Uh, I need everybody [chuckling] to make a Dexterity saving throw."
38,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [very quietly] Shit.
39,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, These dice...
40,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [Ecstatic laughter]
41,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Whoa, he did it! "
42,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Nat 20, nat 20! "
43,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
44,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," We were, we were audio testing and Dad was showing his fancy dice off ‘cause when you roll a 20 it flashes and makes noise and Dad said, “I’ve literally never seen that happen before”. "
45,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So I won! 
46,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience member, Go Merle!]
47,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, 11."
48,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Um, I rolled...fourteen plus two, sixteen. "
49,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay. Uh, Taako, you fall twenty feet and splash into a gigantic pool of acid."
50,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It happens!
51,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And as you hit the acid and take damage, you see what looks like two glowing, like, holographic hearts float up and away from your body and disappear. And floating in this pool are the bones and nearly eroded-away armaments of long-lost adventurers who met with a similar fate to the one you’re about to succumb to. "
52,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"Uh, “the smooth walls of this pit are lined with a spiral of two-inch-wide holes which you cannot see into. Far far above this pit in the ceiling of the room you just fell from is a circular trapdoor the exact circumference of this pit, uh and from behind that trapdoor you can hear rumbling”. ",
53,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"Magnus and Merle, from atop this pit you see your friend fall inside and land in acid, what do you do?",
54,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Right— 
55,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Are you okaay?
56,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, What the fuck does it look like? 
57,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, I think you fell!
58,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Good, oh, that’s good, you’re on the right track!"
59,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Do you want us to get you out of the hole?
60,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, No! I have magical powers. 
61,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [laughing] As— as Taako says that, he dissolves completely and disappears."
62,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Well, and that ends Taako. You were all here for it."
63,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Should be a chill night, for the J-man."
64,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you do see all of his great stuff and some treasure floating down in the pool…"
65,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I use the grappling hook to save the treasure and stuff.
66,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Um, make a, I don’t know, a grappling hook roll. Uh, roll a D20."
67,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Uh, 15."
68,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay. You bend over to fish out some of the, uh, some of the, uh, treasure..."
69,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That is not what I said!
70,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Merle what are you doing during this?
71,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Uh, I’m…I’ll heal him."
72,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheering and laughing],
73,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. This is good.
74,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Now, I did— now, okay."
75,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Merle, you lean over the pit to try to cast a spell to heal your… dissooolved?...friend…"
76,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s gonna have to be one hell of a roll!
77,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," It’s gonna be a good heal, man!"
78,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As the two of you are leaning over this pit, the trapdoor above you opens, and drops a deluge of acid on the two of you as well, dissolving both of you also instantly. And as you’re killed, your body fractures into a million tiny multicolored squares which hover and gather where you died and then soar up into the air and out of the room you’re in, and through a twisting corridor, much fast— uh, much too fast for you to try and get your bearings. "
79,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And then, all three of you are back and standing in a long stone-wrought hallway. Behind you, the hallway extends thirty feet and at that end you see, like, a slope of dirt and sandstone bricks leading upward and out of sight and there’s some sunlight shining down from that, uh, that rough staircase.",
80,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And in the other direction away from that entrance, it— the hallway extends and it’s far too dark for you to see anything. ",
81,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And after surveying this scene, the three of you notice an image in the upper-left corner of your periphery, and as you turn your head, the image moves with you. Like, it’s in a static position, and it depicts a small— ",
82,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Can you do that again? Yeah.
83,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It depicts a small, armor-clad hero, and then a times symbol, and then the number eight. And as you’re reformed in this hallway that counter drops down to five. And you hear the disembodied voice of Lucas Miller, the scientist [audience applause] the scientist you saved one fateful Candlenights, say"
84,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Uh, okay, so…that didn’t go so great. I may need to tune down the difficulty settings a little later on—"
85,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Yes! Don’t make it difficult, that’s not our thing at all!"
86,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," What’s the backstory of why we fuckin’ agreed to do this? Cause right now, [crosstalk] that stairway’s looking pretty good to Taako."
87,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Hey, wait— [crosstalk] Justin? Character voices."
88,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[raucous audience applause],
89,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That wasn’t— no.
90,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Yeah!
91,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] No, no, no!"
92,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Character voices!!!
93,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] That was OOC.
94,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Okay. No. Before you cheer for this dullard, I— when have you ever heard someone in your real life say ‘What’s the backstory’? I was talking to, fucking talking to Griffin."
95,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ask, ask, ask Lucas Miller what’s up."
96,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Um, what?"
97,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I’m not gonna tell you what’s up, but Lucas Miller will."
98,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Uh, character voices."
99,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," But we know where we— okay, do we— is this—"
100,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] You don’t remember what’s up.
101,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Is this in media res or in media non-res?
102,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," We’re in media res, dude. [crosstalk]"
103,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Okay, media res—"
104,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] We are in the media and it is res.
105,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Hey, Lucas, Lucas—"
106,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Theatre degree.
107,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Lucas, my man, remind me why we’re here?"
108,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Lucas says
109,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Wait, you...you seriously don’t remember? I—"
110,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Fuck off with that, seriously. [audience laughter]"
111,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas, I wonder if the brain spike is having some sort of effect on your short-term memory—
112,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Are we in the fucking Matrix?
113,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas, You’re in a virtual reality program that I designed to help train members of the Bureau of Balance.
114,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Matrix.
115,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," It’s Matrix-esque. Really, what it’s modelled after is an old dungeon in an old fantasy game I used to play…it’s called the Tomb of Horrors.  "
116,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience applause],
117,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Y’all NERDS!
118,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] You were waitin’ for it!
119,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Aaawwh, geek check! Got you."
120,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Y’all were making pretty good progress. The goal is to reach the end of the tomb and destroy the evil demilich Acererak, and claim his treasure for your own. Y’all started out with ten lives, but it looks like you burned through half of them. You’ll need to be much more careful if you want to clear this dungeon."
121,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And then in the bottom right corner of your vision some words start appearing, and then a chat message from a user named ‘BoyDetective15’—"
122,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience screams],
123,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Different guy.
124,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It’s a, yeah, it’s a different, it’s uh— no, it’s Angus McDonald. It says"
125,SDCC San Diego Live Show,BoyDetective15," please be careful, sirs! [awws from crowd]"
126,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And then another message from ‘killerkillian’ pops up—
127,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience screams],
128,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Okay, we’ll be here all night!"
129,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Is that all the show’s gonna be, just droppin’ cameos like that?"
130,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, I guess so. That’s fun, that’s a fun— hey Kravitz!"
131,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[audience cheers, Griffin makes mind-explosion noise]",
132,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Hey, good idea."
133,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, All right. A message from killerkillian pops up that says
134,SDCC San Diego Live Show,killerkillian, someone better turn on easy mode
135,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Hey, shut up!"
136,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And then another message from a user just named ‘Leon’ just says
137,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Leon, lol [pronounced loh-wel]
138,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And you hear Lucas again, and he says"
139,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Just keep moving forward, and watch each other’s backs. Your real bodies are totally safe in my lab, I— I promise."
140,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Yeah, I believe that."
141,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Um, so what’s the exit? What do we have here?"
142,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Well, I’ll tell you, using mostly descriptions from “The Tomb of Horrors”"
143,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"“You reach the end of the hallway, away from the entrance, and are standing before three features of interest. The first is an archway. [with increasing drama] The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapours.”",
144,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah.
145,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Someone’s been vaping!
146,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Someone’s been vaping.
147,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Someone’s been vaping thick cotton!
148,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Gary Gygax invented vaping. Tweet it!
149,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," “The stones on either side of the base and the keystone protrude slightly from the stones around them. As you move to within touching distance, the left-hand base stone begins to glow yellow, the right-hand base stone orange, and the keystone, seven feet above, blue.”"
150,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, what?"
151,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Should we be writing this down?
152,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," “The second feature worth noting is directly in front of you, at the far end of the hall. On the hall before you is a relief sculpture of a great green devil face, formed of mosaic tiles. The face has a huge O of a mouth—” its o-face, if you will— “inside of which the space is dead black.” "
153,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"“The most outstanding feature in this location is actually outstanding”— wait, what? Oh, no, it’s like outstanding from the wall, okay. “Two jackal-headed human figures are painted so as to appear to be holding a real bronze chest that protrudes from the wall.”",
154,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"Uh, that’s it. So you have the chest being held by two jackal-headed human figures, the great green devil face with the O-mouth that is filled with—",
155,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, How big is his O-mouth?
156,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Um, it’s three feet in diameter."
157,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I throw Chance Lance into it.
158,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay. [pause] Uh. It goes in.
159,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, We did it!
160,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And then I call it back.
161,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You do what?
162,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I call it back?
163,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh. [laughing] No, you don’t."
164,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Don’t put your hand into the O-face.
165,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, your lance is... gone."
166,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s not real. I mean—
167,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It’s real to me, damn it!"
168,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Okay, I take several steps back from the chest, and I cast Knock on it."
169,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, What does that do?
170,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," It, uh, opens it. I could read you a fucking card if you want, but it opens it."
171,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I also want to say, as he’s doing this, I am continually trying to call back Chance Lance."
172,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," All right, so Merle, what are you doing while Taako casts Knock?"
173,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Um, I guess I will investigate the two—"
174,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [warningly] Donnn’t.
175,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Uh—
176,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You’ll die. Whatever you’re about to do, you’ll die. You’re gonna make a joke [Griffin laughing], and Griffin’s gonna smile in his shitty way that he does, and then he’s going to kill you. We gotta play this one straight, Clint."
177,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, All right. [writing it down] Don’t… examine… protruding… chest.
178,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Correct.
179,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The chest opens.
180,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Hell yeah!
181,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Travis and Clint sing the Final Fantasy victory theme],
182,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I, uh, I look— Mm—"
183,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Mm— 
184,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," From where I am, a good distance away, I kinda… echolocate what might be in the chest."
185,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[Griffin cackles, Travis makes bat noises]",
186,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, What’s that sound like?
187,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [high pitched boop mimicking submarine sonar]
188,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Using that method, it appears to be empty."
189,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, You’re not gonna make him roll for that?
190,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] For echolocation?
191,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] You’re just gonna let him echolocate?
192,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, Taako canonically has bat powers now. It— it— it appears? to be empty."
193,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s the shitty way I was talking about.
194,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Okay, well then there’s nothing, the chest is nothing. Everyone, the chest is empty and nothing, so let’s move on to something else."
195,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [high-pitched] Eeeemmhhhmmm…
196,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Lucas, this sucks."
197,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You hear Lucas go
198,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas, [high-pitched] Eeeeeehhhhhhhhmmmmmmhhhhmmmm…..
199,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Ohhh—
200,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Find Traps.
201,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay. [beat] Your fuckin’ brain explodes. You just hear a million voices scream like ‘YES!’ [pause] You hear a voice scream “IT’S THE TOMB OF HORRORS! THERE’S A MILLION OF THEM!”
202,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Well, I can reuse this, can’t I?"
203,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I guess so? The answer’s not going to change.
204,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You know what, fuck it, I stick my hand in the chest."
205,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s—
206,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Wouldn’t Magnus do that? [audience assents] Thank you. I also agree.
207,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The lid of the chest slams down on your hand and you feel sharp poisonous needles jab into the top of your hand—
208,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I immediately chop off my arm. [cheers]
209,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," No no no no no no! Huh-uh, huh-uh, huh-uh—"
210,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’ve trained for this moment!
211,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," No, no, no, if anybody gets to do it, it’s me."
212,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You’re too slow, old man!"
213,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, No—
214,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Let Daddy—
215,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’ve done it already! Do I need to roll an attack against myself?
216,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, roll an attack against your own arm what are you doing?"
217,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Not great. Well, here’s the good news— well, bad news is, I rolled a five— "
218,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Hey. Wait, quick time-out. What’s worse a good attack on yourself or a bad attack on yourself?"
219,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," A good, a good— listen, this is a surgery roll. You want high numbers right now."
220,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Well— oh, okay, well, I rolled uh…five, plus a ten is a fifteen— but I don’t get out of the way of my own attack. I choose not to defend."
221,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Wait, how on earth— how on earth do you add ten?"
222,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s my attack.
223,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, He’s very good at attacking. [crosstalk] Okay—
224,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Wow.
225,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, You can— you can shoot flames from your hands and levitate! I just hit stuff good! Please!
226,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Nah, it’s fine, it’s fine."
227,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Magnus, you take damage, and as you do you see something new appear in the upper right corner of your periphery. Three hearts pop into view, and as you cut off your own arm? Uh, two of them disappear, leaving heart-shaped outlines in their place."
228,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," I’m gonna need some cauterizing magic, guys."
229,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Nope.
230,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, actually, you seem to be fine."
231,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m awesome.
232,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I mean...[beat] fine-ish.
233,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m all right.
234,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, you’re all right. [audience boos at the pun] Oh, alright, alright. Uh, after the chest—"
235,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Wait. Let it.
236,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, it’s a real thinker."
237,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," They’re done, they’re done."
238,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," After slamming down on your hand that way, the chest lid lifts open and the trap is disarmed. Oh!"
239,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[pun-based laughter],
240,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I spend the whole rest of this period just looking at Merle going ‘ehh? eh??’.
241,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So now there’s an arm in it.
242,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yes. And… maybe other stuff.
243,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," No, don’t reach in there!"
244,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, actually, the arm also turned into pixels and floated away. Yeah, it’s beautiful."
245,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’ll see you again at the crossroads! I stole that joke from Justin earlier.
246,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, What do you do?
247,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," It’s just a Bone reference, it’s not really a joke."
248,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, it’s not really anything."
249,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s fair. I go home.
250,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Can you guys angle your mics? I’m just worried about plosives. That’s not a joke.
251,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That’s bad, that’s the opposite of doing it—"
252,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] No, not like that. Look how Daddy’s doing it, look how Daddy Justin’s doing it. Not Daddy Daddy— Papa Justin. No, look, [high-pitched] fucking look! There we go. Yeah. Mic at the mouth, not mouth at the mic, we gotta— how’s this been, this past thirty seconds, pretty good?"
253,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[Griffin cackles, audience cheers]",
254,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Normally, this is the stuff we edit out, but you’re not gonna leave, so I just have to say it in front of you."
255,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, If everybody could just plug their ears for a second while Justin coaches me through good audio recording?
256,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Hey Dad, if you want to get crazy and do the same thing I just made Travis do, go for it."
257,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I have been in the radio business for forty-five years— 
258,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay, the chest— the chest trap is disarmed. You have the devil’s mouth and the mist door."
259,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Does the Chance Lance break, or is it just stuck in there?"
260,SDCC San Diego Live Show,{{00,1811}}
261,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As it enters into that inky blackness, it’s not like throwing it down a hole where you can see it drop a little bit and then disappear, as soon as it goes— [crosstalk] like crosses, "
262,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] It’s just nothing?
263,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, It’s just nothingness.
264,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Ok.
265,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah. Chest trap’s disarmed. Mist door, devil mouth."
266,SDCC San Diego Live Show,        Magnus," Well I took the last one, so uh..."
267,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Is there any exit from this room?
268,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I mean the entrance where you came in.
269,SDCC San Diego Live Show,{{00,1836}}
270,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Well that’s nothing.
271,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And the mist door…
272,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, And the mist door.
273,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And the mist door, yeah."
274,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, So what’s the— tell me about the mist door.
275,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Well, I’ll tell you all about the mist door, Justin. “The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapors” [crosstalk] The stones—"
276,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
277,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the left stone of the door is glowing yellow. Uh, the right one is orange and the top one is blue."
278,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Left yellow, top—"
279,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Top blue. Right orange. [yelling] This is such a shitty puzzle! I don’t know why they put this in the game!
280,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Ok, I don’t want to get technical, but you put it in the game this time."
281,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, S’true.
282,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
283,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," And to get even more technical, you plagiarized it from something else."
284,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, That is also true.
285,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Ok, so… all- do the, do the tiles have any give if I push them? Are they buttons?"
286,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yes, they click in and they make a pleasant chime. What did you push in?"
287,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Uh… 
288,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
289,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Nothing, I just asked a question [crosstalk] if they do that."
290,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Ok well there’s no way you can discern that information without doing it. So I— forget what I just said. [crosstalk] Eternal Sunshine.
291,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] You did, ten minutes ago, let him echolocate. So you’re drawing a fairly fine line now!"
292,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s true."
293,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, I’m going to cast “True Seeing.”"
294,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok.
295,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, This gives me the ability to see things as they actually are. Which in this case is the solution to the puzzle. [Audience laughter] I just wanna see what it actually is.
296,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Um. You can tell because you can see through the facade of this door the order that these buttons are supposed to be pressed are yellow, blue, and orange."
297,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [taking notes] Yellow, Blue, Orange. Ok I do that."
298,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, yeah. The mists disappear."
299,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [sings Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare] Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dun-duh-duh! Thank you magic powers!
300,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You hear— You hear Lucas say,"
301,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas, I am sorry about that one— This is not a good puzzle.
302,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, How were you supposed to figure that out? What was the— [crosstalk] Ok.
303,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," [crosstalk] Yeah exactly, I think it was just a guessing game. Um. It was made in the 70’s and people were doing a lot of peyote back then. Um—"
304,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
305,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," So when— when, uh... [crosstalk]"
306,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Yes we were.
307,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Griffin and audience laughs],
308,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, He says as he drinks his Diet Coke from a Tervis tumbler.
309,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, It’s a Doctor Who Tervis tumbler!
310,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ah, that’s way better."
311,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Doctor Who on BBC America
312,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Fuckin- fuckin’ Moon Dog. Just keep rollin’!
313,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, after you clear the archway of mist and start passing through it, another pe— message pops up in the chat from username Bluntlord420. Uh, who says"
314,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Bluntlord420, niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.
315,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And then another message from Bluntlord420 who says
316,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Bluntlord420, This is Robbie btw.
317,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
318,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheering],
319,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You movin’ on?
320,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah we’ll go through that door.
321,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, yeah you uh all go through that door and the three of you work your way through a claustrophobic corridor and enter a small dark room. And as you do, you hear the entrance you just passed through slam shut behind you. And as you turn around, you notice that the entrance has disappeared completely. Immediately, torches mounted on the wall spark to life revealing the contents of this chamber. Three large chests are affixed firmly to the floor. The western one is gold plate covering iron. I don’t know why they included that, like you’re just gonna fuckin’ steal the chest and be like “Nice try!”. Uuuuh. I’ve got a chest of gold now. Uh, this center one is silver plate over iron and the eastern one is of, uh, is oak bound with uh bronze. It’s oak bound with thick bronze bands. Each is— "
322,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Is this your first time reading this?
323,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yes. Each is about four feet long, two feet wide, and three feet high. And as you enter this room a username Dragonzord, who is Carey, chats and says uh— she chats and says"
324,SDCC San Diego Live Show,        Dragonzord," OOOOOF! I remember this one, good luck!"
325,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Then tell me the answer!
326,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Yeah, what’s the answer?"
327,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, There’s no response.
328,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Damnit!
329,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Classic.
330,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Wait! I know this one! I know this one.
331,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Gold, silver, and oak chests. What do you do?"
332,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, The oak is the chest of a carpenter!
333,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience applause],
334,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah. I, I crawl on my knees to that one, the penitent man shall pass. Penitent uh… man shall pass. Fuckin’ Last Crusade? Are we not doing Last Crusade?"
335,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, no we’re doing Last Crusade."
336,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Is that not the joke that we’re doing?
337,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, What’s the fuckin’ sh—  cuz I’m better at Last Crusade than you all? I get punished by not laughing at me? Seems kinda shitty.
338,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, try it again. Take two. [crosstalk] We’ll edit that."
339,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah. yeah-yeah-yeah. Penitent man shall pass, right?"
340,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[Travis, Justin, Clint, and audience give hearty fake laughter.]",
341,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Wait a minute. Do that Police Squad freeze frame.
342,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
343,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Um….ok, well I did— cool."
344,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, I did cool things for the last one.
345,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, I lost my arm on the last one!
346,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, Fair.
347,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako & Magnus, Merle?
348,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
349,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I’ve been saving this spell since we started playing this game three and a half years ago.
350,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Translation, he didn’t know he had it."
351,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You literally just found it in your deck.
352,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I cast Hero’s Feast!
353,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
354,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] And we all sit down to a nice dinner before moving on!
355,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Do you remember— no no no. Do you remember the conversation where we had, literally right backstage, we were like “Let’s just keep a nice pace movin’, just chew through the adventure.” and you’re like “a b— bountiful bouquet of meats and breads!”"
356,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, You bring forth a great feast including magnificent food and drink. It takes an hour to consume.
357,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience applause],
358,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Why?
359,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And we’re gonna do it in real time!
360,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Why?
361,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!
362,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Why?
363,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, The creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits!
364,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Speed— 
365,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Health insurance! Dental!
366,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, It makes all wisdom saving throws with advantage and hit points of all creatures maximum increases by 2d-freakin’-10!
367,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
368,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Stop. Stop. Stop. You’re embarrassing yourselves. Stop it. One, we don’t have hit points, that was nothing. To start with, there’s no hit points, remember, just the hearts."
369,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Oh. Shit.
370,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, So that’s nothing. That part was nothing. And I guess wisdom sa— I mean
371,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, This is a delicious sandwich— my arm’s back!
372,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Can we translate that hitpoint game to hearts? For him?
373,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, all of you have on extra heart. You’re up to four. I’ll give you that. And you have advantage on wisdom saving throws. Maybe, uh, the chests would be cool to— "
374,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, we’re not done eating."
375,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Everyone sit in silence.
376,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," You know, the whole “keep the pace movin’” thing you asked us about."
377,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ok. Gold, silver— "
378,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [exasperated yelling] OPEN A FUCKING CHEST! OPEN ONE!
379,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You know what, I’m already injured, so I, I’ll do it. I open the oak chest."
380,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You just— 
381,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Nope! Wait!
382,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Laughter],
383,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," When the lid of the oak chest is opened, a large humanoid creature with the head and wings of a bat. Or, if you will, a bat-man. Uh, will be instantly teleported into the room and it strikes with surprise. Magnus!"
384,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [with trepidation] Yes?
385,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, does 22 hit your AC?"
386,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [pause] …Little bit.
387,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah… 
388,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, …Little bit it does. 
389,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The bat-man swipes a jagged claw through Magnus and as he does, [crosstalk] Mag— uh."
390,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I’m gonna use Parry.
391,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, He chose [crosstalk]… poorly.
392,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] They could use…
393,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
394,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s another ‘Last Crusade’ for you guys.
395,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Um
396,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," There is, there is— Parry just reduces damage. It’s not gonna [crosstalk]— You only—"
397,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Yes. And I use… crying.
398,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
399,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Clint laughs],
400,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, This bat-man rakes a claw through Magnus and as he does Magnus explodes into pixels.
401,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, See y’all later!
402,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And you see that counter in the corner turn to the number four.
403,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Shit.
404,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Magnus very quickly though, you appear back at— where the entrance to this room was."
405,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, I’m back!
406,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, I’m not gonna make you all roll initiative because we’ll do that for a different thing, but uhhh what do you do about this bat-man who’s now in the room."
407,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Round two, bat-man!"
408,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," After one of you does something, the bat-man will also do something."
409,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, I’ll cast fireball at the bat to kill it."
410,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok. Uh, does that—"
411,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait! Maybe he’s friendly— wait, no he did just kill me."
412,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, he just killed you."
413,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, no you could talk to it [crosstalk] Maybe you just—"
414,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] The bat that eviscerated you might be our friend.
415,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Bat-man!
416,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The bat-man says [beast noises]
417,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[laughter],
418,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And then he points to buffet and he says
419,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Batman, [garbled] Is this for anyone or can I get down on it?
420,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Yeah, no— Wait. Hold on. Which chest do we open and then you can have some turkey."
421,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Batman, I got— I was protecting the chest!
422,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Sugar water!
423,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Batman," Best Sugar— put it in a Snapple, son I wanna eat those!"
424,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] God, I hope nobody just walked in."
425,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] I’m sorry, what?... Which chest?"
426,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Batman," No, I wanna eat the apples and bananas first!"
427,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," You can have an apple, but you can have a banana after you tell me. Apples first."
428,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, This is the best thing I’ve ever done with my life.
429,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
430,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Talk to my brother, as a bat-man, about bananas."
431,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," By the way, I’m gonna be the new Batman after Ben Affleck [pause] leaves, and it’s gonna be this voice."
432,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
433,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Batman, What’s the [unintelligible] 
434,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, It was a little—
435,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It would still be better than Christian Bale.
436,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, what—"
437,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Is he here tonight? I’m sorry—
438,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Probably not.
439,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
440,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] uh, what—"
441,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] We’re fans, Chris."
442,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I cast a Fireball at your dumb bat.
443,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, I make a dexterity saving throw."
444,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Sure.
445,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You have the card, right? I rolled a three, so there’s nothing I’m gonna add to that that’s gonna be sufficient."
446,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Uh. Sorry what?
447,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I fucked uuup?
448,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Ok.
449,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience Laughter] ,
450,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Hurt the bat with fire now.
451,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] So, you’re gonna 8d6."
452,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Jesus Christ. Just roll one and times eight! We’re on rain pace.
453,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Do what?
454,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Just roll 1d8, or whatever, d6 and we’ll multiply it by 8."
455,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [softly] that’s a 6
456,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," That’s a 6, ok."
457,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Jesus Christ.
458,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
459,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, Magic!
460,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, 48.
461,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, I can fuckin’ multiply six times eight. Uh, the bat sees the fireball coming at it and just nervously reaches over and grabs an apple and [monster noises] and then explodes as the fireball hits it for 48 fucking points of damage."
462,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Good.
463,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you killed bat-man."
464,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I solved your bat puzzle.
465,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [laughs] Yeah, you killed bat-man."
466,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
467,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Inside the oak chest is nothing.
468,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I get inside of the oak chest. I close it…[pause] No I don’t! That’s a joke.
469,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, no. nothing happens. There’s nothing."
470,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I get back out of the oak chest.
471,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, you’re embarrassed now."
472,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I— but I do have fun like “Yeah!” when I come out.
473,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Silver chest and gold chest. What do you do?
474,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Uuuuuhm.
475,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Open one [crosstalk] coward.
476,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Literally, It’s 50-50."
477,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Merle, I open the silver chest!
478,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," So, you’re saying that— wait, stop."
479,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, That was in a character voice!
480,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Stop, stop."
481,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," So wait, hold on."
482,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," So wait, hold on. Hol— ok, so."
483,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You, Merle, are looking at Taako and going, “I open—”"
484,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," You say, out loud, to me, “I open the silver chest.”"
485,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Alright, I open the silver chest."
486,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Alright, I look at you and say"
487,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Oh-kay, you dooo? Go on."
488,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," And for a second, Magnus and Taako just look very concerned at Merle, like “Oh it’s happening.”"
489,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," So concerned. Your twilight years have come. Sooner than we expected, it’s so sad. But hey, we had a good run. Ok, so—"
490,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, We put him in an old dwarf’s home.
491,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Inside the silver chest is a clear crystal box worth 1000 gold pieces that holds a silver scepter.
492,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, There was a man-bat in mine!
493,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [Unsympathetic] Yeah.
494,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh— I, I take the scepter—"
495,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Wait a minute. No no no no. uh uh
496,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," You did something, It’s my turn to do something."
497,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The scepter’s in the— the crystal box has the scepter in it and it’s inside the chest. You just get the whole thing out—
498,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Y’all, this is Tomb of Horrors, it’s not just like, “Here’s an awesome scepter.”"
499,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, I pick it up and I smash it on the ground."
500,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, when the box is lifted from the supposed bottom of the chest, eight darts will fire upward and the one or two characters leaning over the chest, so as to be exposed in the line of fire, will take, uh, hurts. Hurting damage. Uh, you take three hearts worth of damage. It’s good that Merle boosted you up like that, as a bevy, a salvo of darts are flung into your face and chest."
501,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [beat] Happens.
502,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I open…the other chest that’s still closed.
503,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh, great! "
504,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, [crosstalk]"
505,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Wait, did I get the scepter?"
506,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, did you— what did you do with the crystal chest after you lifted it out and got hit by a bunch of darts? Taako."
507,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I, well… I smashed it on the ground is what I said."
508,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, it’s no longer worth 1000 gold pieces, but you get the silver scepter from out of the chest and as you smash it and claim the scepter, a wooden, arched doorway suddenly appears in a puff of smoke at the end of the room."
509,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I stop just before opening the other chest.
510,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Aaaaaall right. Fair enough.
511,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you move through that doorway?"
512,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yes!
513,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Sure.
514,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Yes!
515,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, As you pass through that doorway the three of you are moving down another long hallway lined with torches.
516,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Oh good.
517,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Is it nice?
518,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin,"Uh, I mean it’s the fucking Tomb of Horrors, [crosstalk] man. There’s nothing that’s super nice in here."
519,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [Crosstalk] But like, but like is it nice?"
520,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, it’s a nice horror tomb..."
521,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I’m saying, there can be traps and there can be danger, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be nice tapestries."
522,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Well, it’s weird that you say that, Travis. Uh, as you’re moving down this— [crosstalk] Torch-lined hallway,"
523,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis,[crosstalk] Is it?
524,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Apparently not!
525,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you start to see something odd. The flame on the torches freeze suddenly in place and the cobblestones that comprise the walls and the floor— they start to flicker almost like they’re glitching out."
526,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," You all see this too, right?"
527,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, Yup.
528,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, they do, yeah."
529,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," I just thought that it was kicking in, you know?"
530,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And after—
531,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, I took a bunch of ecstasy before starting.
532,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Not me, Magnus did. [crosstalk] Magnus did."
533,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin,[crosstalk] Magnus did. Magnus is a certified party boy and that’s all there is to it.
534,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Well, he’s been spending a lot of time at Joshua Tree, just really getting centered."
535,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, With ecstasy?
536,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Yeah, it’s fucked up!"
537,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I feel really centered right now! [mimes waving glowsticks]
538,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[laughter],
539,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," These were glow sticks— y’all saw the glow sticks in my— ok. Uh, this entire place is glitching out around you, and after a few seconds, the hallway disappears completely and you’re standing in just an empty black void and you hear Lucas’ voice only it’s super distorted and he’s saying"
540,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Wait, what’s going on? I— I’m losing them. What’s happening to the simulation?"
541,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, What happened to the distortion?
542,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Well I… wanted them to hear me. Get off my jock. Um, suddenly the three of you are standing on a small fishing boat."
543,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Aw, nice."
544,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, In the middle of a large lake. And you’re— you’re outside and it’s a beautiful sunny day.
545,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Finally my dad’s taking me fishing!
546,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And as you get your bearings on this boat, some words appear in front of all of you in these bright block letters. And they read Big Bass Challenge!"
547,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yay!
548,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
549,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And as those words appear, some bright, poppy music starts playing. And uh, in the back of the boat there’s a bearded man in a big floppy hat on the boat with you and he’s drinking drinking something out of a big jug and he says"
550,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal," Welcome to Big Bass Challenge! Welcome to Big Bass Challenge, I’m Rascal! Y’all ready to catch some Big Bass?"
551,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Am I ever?!
552,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, Always!
553,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[pause],
554,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, I like Big Bass and I cannot lie!
555,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
556,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I’m all about that bass.
557,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
558,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I love fishin’.
559,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
560,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Got ‘em.
561,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I don’t— I didn’t get the other two references.
562,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, He says
563,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal, I don’t know where you strange travelers hail from—
564,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I kill Rascal.
565,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[laughter],
566,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Yeah…yeah pretty much.
567,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I just wanna take away any joy Griffin has.
568,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Travis punches him in the head and he’s full of piñata candy. Nobody saw this coming.
569,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [sounding dejected] Go ahead and roll… 
570,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He said we had to keep a fast pace!
571,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [pouting] ...go ahead and roll a d20...
572,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Wait, why are you?— this is so outta—"
573,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," It’s a 16 plus 9! Sorry, plus 10. 26."
574,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Wait, this is very out of character, I don’t believe that you would kill Rascal. That doesn’t make sense to me."
575,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Yeah.
576,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I feel like that’s the—
577,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [sarcastically] Thanks, Reddit!"
578,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[Griffin cackles, audience cheers]",
579,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [laughing] Oh, shit."
580,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You, uh— what do you attack him with? Railsplitter?"
581,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," No, I just kinda, whooa—"
582,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, you fuckin’ attack Rascal—"
583,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I punch him. I punch him with Phantom Fist. [crosstalk] And I just push him out of the boat.
584,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] You punch him with Phantom Fist and—
585,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m just pushing him out of the boat.
586,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He flies backwards off the boat, and he says"
587,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal," R— [Griffin tries miming being hit, breaks down laughing]"
588,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," ...What does he say, Griffin?"
589,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, what’s he say? Tell me what he says!"
590,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, H— he says— [more laughing]
591,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal, Time for Rascal to fly to Jesus!
592,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And a— a big— a big, big bass jumps out of the water and eats him in midair. [audience applause] And now, Rascal’s dead."
593,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Cosplay that!
594,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As Rascal is killed, a fishing rod and tackle box appear where he was sitting; it’s the loot he dropped. And as those items appear, some words appear on your, like, interface, that read ‘Catch a Big Bass to Proceed!’"
595,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Hey— speaking of Reddit, I think no one can really accuse Griffin of railroading us anymore, since we just killed his whole thing. We killed his guy. All right. Um, I’m going to—"
596,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m going to use Animal Handling.
597,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, To order fish to jump onto your hook?
598,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Yeah, I’m gonna do the Ernie[?]. No, let Justin do what he’s gonna do if that’s an actual thing that might help the story."
599,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Do I see the big basses in there?
600,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You can see several, like, shadows under the water, and one of them is quite large. And it is the one who just killed…my favourite person."
601,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I appreciate you for acknowledging I didn’t kill Rascal the bass did.
602,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Okay. Well, uh, I’m gonna center on the place where I see that fish, and all of his other fish friends, and I’m gonna cast Reverse Gravity."
603,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
604,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I will need the description on that one if you’ve got it.
605,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," It reverses gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder, centred on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a dexterity saving throw to grab on to a fixed object it can reach. Good luck, it’s a lake. If some solid object such as a ceiling is encountered, bla bla bla, there’s no ceiling… um… it will remain oscillating there for the duration at the top."
606,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay. A cylinder of water levitates out of the lake, several feet in front of the… stern of the boat? Which side’s the front?"
607,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Uh, the left."
608,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[at least 5 separate audience members yell ‘Bow’],
609,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Bow.
610,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The bow.
611,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, The bow. Yeah.
612,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I get them confused. Okay, the fucking front of the boat."
613,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Thank you.
614,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] I don’t know why I had to get nautical on it—
615,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, The sternum is the other side.
616,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," A fifty-foot cylinder of water raises up out of the water, and inside that you can see several small shapes still floating around, but one of them is clearly the Big Bass. That killed my best friend, Rascal."
617,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wracked with guilt, uh—"
618,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," All right, Taako lays back in the boat and says"
619,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," There, do somethin’ with that!"
620,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wracked with guilt, I am going, um—"
621,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Rascal was very evil. I’ll just say it now. He had a whole turn at the end where it turned out, like… this is also the finale of the Adventure Zone, and he was gonna be the big bad guy at the end of it…"
622,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [disappointed] Awww.
623,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, With my rapier-
624,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
625,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I am going to leap at the fish and swim over to it.
626,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay?
627,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And I am going to cut it open and save Rascal. [audience cheers]
628,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [exasperated yelling] You can’t just say shit!
629,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, You let Justin echolocate! Let me save Rascal! This’ll be good for both of us.
630,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, You can see how that would give Travis an unclear view of his abilities. You did let me echolocate.
631,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, okay, you jump into this fifty-foot column of water. Can Magnus—"
632,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," And I also do want to point out, this is not OOC. Everything I just said to you Magnus did say out loud."
633,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," I’m gonna jump at the fish, I’m gonna swim in the water, I’m gonna cut it open, I’m gonna save that guy I just killed!"
634,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah. Roll— roll Athletics? To, like, represent your ability to jump into a column of water and swim to locate a fish. Like, if it’s low, I think you can’t even open your eyes super-good underwater."
635,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s a 13 total.
636,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, alright, yeah, I think you can kinda get a bead on where this fish is, but you’re gonna have disadvantage on an attack."
637,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s fine.
638,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," —‘cause you’re fucking underwater trying to cut it open with a rapier— none of that is intended, like none of that’s how any of that’s supposed to—"
639,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna attack it.
640,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
641,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," It’s a 16, plus 10, 26."
642,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And that disadvantage?
643,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Oh, that’s a 3, plus 10. And then, uh, I am going to, uh…"
644,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Usually you say Action Surge.
645,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," If the end of this sentence isn’t ‘be devoured by a large bass,’ then you’re lying to everybody here."
646,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m gonna use Precision Strike.
647,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
648,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, To add to an attack roll.
649,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, All right.
650,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Um, that’s a d8…"
651,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, A d8? Fuck.
652,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Nope, sorry, d10. ‘Scuse me."
653,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Jesus, no, that’s worse."
654,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s an 8.
655,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay.
656,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Plus, uh, so 21 was the final roll."
657,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay, uh, yeah, roll damage. That’s a hit on a fish. [applause] That’s a fish hit. As Magnus stabs his rapier through this fish, all of you see the words “FISH ON!” appear on your screen. And the music changes, all of a sudden it’s like, really poppy and upbeat now."
658,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I cut the fish open.
659,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You c— roll damage! You don’t just cut a fuckin’ fish open! [audience laughter] ‘I stabbed a dragon with a stick and it explodes!’
660,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," It’s... it’s 7. Aw man, I should’ve used the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom."
661,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [laughing] Yeah, but you didn’t. All right, you—"
662,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Oh wait, I don’t have that yet canonically."
663,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You hurt the fish, and as you stab the fish, you see one heart float up and away from it and disappear."
664,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I stab it again, I get a second attack."
665,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. Still disadvantage.
666,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a 17.
667,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, He really does roll like this.
668,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," That’s— a 9. 9 plus 10, 19"
669,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yep. That’s a hit. Roll damage again.
670,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Cut it open
671,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, 2 plus 4. 6.
672,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok another heart floats up and away from this fish. It looks pretty bad off.
673,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Ok. I’m gonna use my third attack.
674,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Well, let’s— "
675,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter] ,
676,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s a 19. [rolls dice again] That’s a 1.
677,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
678,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Travis McElroy has rolled a 1.
679,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, You were here. Can you imagine? You were in the room the room where it happened.
680,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
681,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, wait, wait. I think I have something for this."
682,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, is it."
683,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Somebody take a picture of this.
684,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You don’t. [crosstalk] You are—
685,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Good.
686,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis,I thought that— isn’t that what the Gambler’s Luck does?
687,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Not today friend.
688,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Ok.
689,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The fish, you stab it and it goes like “euuuwhuh” and you stab it again and it’s like “hoohoowlhuh” And then you try to stab it a third time but your rapier kind of bends off its scales and the fish goes, [smugly] “b-h-hooolwlhuh”"
690,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Oh he likes that doesn’t he?
691,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, he likes that. [crosstalk] He’s a dirty fuckin’ fish."
692,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Nasty. Nasty fish.
693,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, It turns and swallows you whole. Make a constit— No it’s not one of those things!"
694,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheers],
695,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Bunch’a... my fucking dad is here! He’s here and on stage! Don’t expose him to this! Make a constitution saving throw.
696,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Only his fuckin’ dad can make jokes like that!
697,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Uh, It’s an eleven total but I’m going to use— This I do have, Indomitable, [crosstalk] to roll that again."
698,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Ok. Yeah roll it again.
699,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Can Justin and I play?
700,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a 4!
701,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok yeah, you take—"
702,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [interrupting Griffin with high pitched noise] 4 plus 8, it’s a 12."
703,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You take two hearts of damage, how are you doin’?"
704,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Doin’ ok!
705,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok.
706,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I just died, so—"
707,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And inside, you fuckin’ like— You’re being eaten by a bass and it’s horrible and uh—"
708,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Do I see Rascal?
709,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You fuckin’ eventually just see, like, Rascal like poking out of its side and it’s been half, sort of, like, added to the form of the fish, Akira-style. And it’s— and he says"
710,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal, Welcome to the jungle!
711,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As you are— Taako and Merle. What do you do? Fish in a floating cylinder of water, [crosstalk] somewhat hurt. You’re in a boat."
712,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] I— I feel— honestly I feel pretty good right now. I’m kicking it. I made the column fly, that was great."
713,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Merle then.
714,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I cast Banishment.
715,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m in it! You asshole!
716,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok.
717,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, He’s in the fish.
718,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Remember? Remember this? [waves wooden arm]
719,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I saved your damn life.
720,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, uh…"
721,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," You have to— the fish has to make [crosstalk] A charisma saving throw, and—"
722,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] A wisdom saving throw?... Charisma? I didn’t give the fish a fucking Charisma stat, Clint!"
723,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," A fish has fins, so it can’t make a throw."
724,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That’s a critical failure, that’s an actual 1."
725,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience cheering],
726,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Uh— [laughs]
727,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," If you wanted it banished, I coulda banished it!"
728,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I sent it to another plane of existence.
729,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah I know what you fuckin’ do to it. Magnus you feel yourself being whisked away to another dimension, I guess? And you see this fish, like also disappearing and you see fucking Rascal inside the fish-guts wall just like"
730,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal, I’m free!
731,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and you are all disappeared, and as you disappear the lives counter drops down to three and then the Tool Tip pops up again [crosstalk] and it says, “Catch a Big Bass to Proceed.” "
732,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [Crosstalk] Wait, not necess—"
733,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And then that Tool Tip, because you’ve fuckin’ like…"
734,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," No wait, I got—"
735,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," —Bethesda-broken the fucking game, [Audience laughter] starts to glitch out."
736,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Where does— Where does Banishment send them?
737,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Um… I guess I get to choose the plane of existence.
738,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I think in this situation, because you’re in a virtual reality simulation, the game doesn’t know how to reconcile this and so the entire environment around you just kinda like glitches out because you fucked up the game and broke it so badly."
739,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So I won?
740,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You’re back in that sort of black space again and Magnus reforms next to you and then all of a sudden there’s—
741,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Seems familiar.
742,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You all are back in that hallway that you were just walking through that froze up. [close to the mic, defeated] I didn’t expect it to go like that… "
743,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience laughter],
744,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, What did you expect to happen?
745,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You to catch a FUCKING FISH IN THE FISH MINIGAME! [Audience cheering] IS THAT SO— AM I OUT OF MY MIND? IS THAT AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION? To give them a fucking fishing minigame. Taako makes the f— the lake float, Travis jumps in with a rapier like “Let’s get it done!”, and then dad makes the fuckin’ shit teleport away!"
746,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Welcome… Welcome to the Adventure Zone, Griffin!"
747,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[Audience cheering, Justin giggles with glee]",
748,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As you come back, the chat, people are just spamming in it, and they’re just saying ‘fish boiiiiiiiiiiis!!!!!’, and, uh, Lucas says"
749,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Big Bass Challenge? God, I haven’t played that game in years…"
750,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, hold on, are we streaming this on Twitch?"
751,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, He says
752,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas, How did you— how did you end up there? That doesn’t make... any sense? I think... I think there might be something wrong with the simulation. I’m gonna pull you out.
753,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And then there’s a pause, and then the three of you feel something... unpleasant. Not here, in the virtual world. You don’t take any damage or anything like that, but you feel your bodies experiencing pain; almost like you’re experiencing a powerful electric shot— uh, shock, rather."
754,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[giggly] I’ve drank almost this whole bottle of wine tonight.,
755,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And then, uh, as you experience this shock, the chat updates again, and this time it’s with a message from the demi-lich Acereak, who says",
756,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Acereak," [in Griffin’s natural voice] Not today, friend."
757,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Does he say it in [high pitched] that voice?
758,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, it’s chat, so it doesn’t say it in any voice. [clears throat] And then as, uh, this lich comments in the thread, the chat is flooded with messages from everyone, all saying in unison"
759,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Everyone, ...wtf?
760,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Lol!
761,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And I think right there we’re gonna take an intermission real quick so we can all run to the bathroom and so you all can run to the bathroom! We’ll be right back in 10 minutes to finish! The adventure!

769,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, no, no, no!"
770,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[more cheering],
771,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, we don’t, we don’t get to do that twice. Uh, this is our first time taki— no, oh Justin’s filming I guess..."
772,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," In case my children and grandchildren are watching this in the future, this is intermission. [crosstalk] They cheered way more [crosstalk], they cheered way more in the intro. The first time we came out, they went bananas. I didn’t film that, sweetie."
773,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Is that 4K???
774,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, We’ve never—
775,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Could you all say—
776,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheering],
777,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Here— I, [crosstalk] here’s what I want everyone to say—"
778,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] It was just like that.
779,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[more cheering],
780,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Ok. And then they— and then they, then they stopped so we could finish the show—"
781,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I’m gonna count down 3-2-1, and after I say 1, I want everyone in unison to say ‘Hi Charlie!’"
782,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Awwww.
783,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Are you ready?
784,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Who’s Charlie?
785,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ok, you ready? Three! [singing] ‘and the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon’...Three! Two! One!"
786,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience, “Hi Charlie!”]
787,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Thank you.
788,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, That was very good. We’ve never—
789,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I would do it for my daughter, but she doesn’t care about y’all."
790,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, We’ve never— [crosstalk]
791,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Because she’s a jock!
792,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh please let me say this sentence. We’ve never taken an intermission before on this show, and, like, an hour before the show we were like, ‘what if we peed during an intermission?’ Instead of spending the last 30 minutes of the podcast like ‘go go go go go! Kill ‘em, kill ‘em, do it!’."
793,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Then they killed a guy! Then they rolled some dice! The end! Thank you!
794,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Ok bye!!
795,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah yeah. During the Austin show all four of us had to pee so bad that Travis would miss on an attack and we’d be like “NOOO!” Okay, let’s get back into it. The three of you hear Lucas say,"
796,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Okay, so, something bad is happening? For some reason I’m unable to pull you out of the simulation."
797,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Not like this.
798,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
799,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Listen, very good. Very good and very... timely. "
800,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
801,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," If you clear this dungeon, the simulation should just boot you out by default? So I think your best bet is to just keep pressing on and try to make some progress."
802,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," What I want right now is, to picture this, whatever the UI, whatever the HUD is, Magnus just slowly pointing at the life times 3, like,"
803,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, (high pitched questioning noise)...?
804,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
805,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," No, I know it’s not great, just, like— be better, I, do—?"
806,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, (repeated high pitch).......?
807,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He says,"
808,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Just, like, do better I guess?"
809,SDCC San Diego Live Show,And then—,
810,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus," Did you program any extra lives, any mushrooms?"
811,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Yeah, sure, any mushrooms we can find?"
812,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, he says—"
813,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Actually, that’s a good idea, hold on, let me see what I can do—"
814,SDCC San Diego Live Show,And then the (laughing) the words— fuckin’— “Game Genie detected!” appears and then the UI statics out and he’s like,
815,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," I tried to use the Game Genie, it didn’t work."
816,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, The Game Djinn!
817,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The what?
818,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Game Djinn! It’s what— ‘cause in D&D there’s djinns... [applause] No, it’s too late! You had your chance!"
819,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [to audience] You behaved appropriately.
820,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As he tries to use the Game Genie, killerkillian pops up in the chat and she’s like "
821,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Killian, lol casual
822,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, What the hell are you people talking about?
823,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
824,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," (shouting) It’s called video games, old man!"
825,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, get with the times!"
826,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, In my day—
827,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, They’re not just Pac-Man anymore.
828,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Actually I would like to hear about back in dad’s day. Can we take a brief—?
829,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, We didn’t “lol”.
830,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis [?}, Wait-
831,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[laughter],
832,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The three of you enter into a long chamber, about 10 feet wide, and you’re standing on a landing. Oh, that’s fun! You’re standing on a landing over a 10-foot-deep pit—"
833,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Oh, you really got dad with that one. [Clint’s laughter/coughing] He’s just never seen you have fun before."
834,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Um, this bottle of wine was just in our green room."
835,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [laughing] Not anymore!
836,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It’s empty— Um, the three of you enter into a long chamber— I did that part. The 10-foot-deep pit with a cobblestone floor— This pit stretches about 50 feet before ending with another landing about 10 feet up, on the far end of the room, and atop that landing you can see an exit to this chamber with torches on either side. Basically, you are standing in front of a 10 foot deep, 50 foot long pit with a cobblestone floor, and across the 50 foot span you can see a landing on the other side with an exit to this chamber, [singsong] what do youuu dooo?"
837,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I hand Taako the end of my rope, and I say"
838,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Hold on to this.
839,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And then I use my grappling hook to get to the landing.
840,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok. Ok, ok. Ok. You’re gonna throw your grappling hook 50 feet?"
841,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," No, my grappling hook shoots [crosstalk], it doesn’t throw."
842,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Oh that’s right, that’s right, I forgot you had some Darkwing Duck shit."
843,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yeahhh.
844,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yeah, fuck it, alright. Uh... make a ranged attack roll, roll a D20. Straight up, no bonuses."
845,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [muted] I don’t think I have to, I think my grappling hook—"
846,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [slightly exasperated] Yeah, but go ahead and roll a D20…."
847,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a 8.
848,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [beat] Nooooooooo.
849,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
850,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Tha— wha— now hold on! That’s like having a sword that I have to roll to see if it stays a sword! The grappling hook just does it, what do you mean— [growls at Griffin]"
851,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [slightly mocking] You— You tried it? And everyone heard you try it, and they’re very impressed with you trying it, but it didn’t wooork."
852,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
853,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Don’t patronize him.
854,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," If it makes you feel any better, if you had succeeded I would’ve made, like, a fuckin’ lion appear and eat the rope or something."
855,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] You’re a wiener!
856,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] So, the pit is below us? Is that right?"
857,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That’s how pits usually work, yeah."
858,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Clint/audience laughter],
859,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I thought we were in the pit alrea— Nevermind.
860,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No no no, it’s below you."
861,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," So, 50-foot wide."
862,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, 50-foot... long."
863,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Landing on the other side.
864,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yep.
865,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Is there anything on the ceiling, anything hanging from the ceiling, any—"
866,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, No.
867,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, They’re just cobblestone?
868,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It’s not a fuckin’ Ninja Warrior, like—"
869,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, So—
870,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Although, hold on— [chuckles] [taking notes] next… live… show… Ninja… Warrior… thoughts?"
871,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, So… it’s just a big open—
872,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah it’s just a 50-foot long pit. [slightly mocking] Boy, you boys are real spooked by the Tomb of Horrors, huh?!"
873,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Ok, wait a minute, wait a minute—"
874,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Wait wait wait. I know this one.
875,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Oh?
876,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s... Leap of Faith.
877,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [audibly smiling] Ok. 
878,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
879,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Uh, we’ve already done one [crosstalk] Indiana Jones joke—"
880,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Now—
881,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Please! Please Christ please follow that— that thread!
882,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," No, we only have three lives left, I’m not doing that joke."
883,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [beat][softly] Please do the joke?
884,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, No!
885,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [slightly whiny] Traaaaviiiiissssss—
886,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Come on Travie, do the joke—"
887,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Wha—
888,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk][whinier] Traaaaviiiiiiiissssss—
889,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] If I do it—
890,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [chanting] Joke! Joke! Joke! Joke!
891,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," If I do it, will you give me the life back?"
892,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, I won’t kill you."
893,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[audience laughter, Travis giggles]",
894,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Alright, fuck it. I go running at the pit."
895,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. You just jump right in?
896,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [shrugging] Yeah.
897,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Alright. Uh, rollllll… Acrobatics. Let’s see if you land on your feet."
898,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I have a pretty good Acrobatics… [dice hits table] 18 plus... 8, 26, [crosstalk] no sorry— 18 plus 9, 27."
899,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Yeah you land— You land all cool at the bottom of the pit and it’s fine.
900,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Come on down! [pause] Pit’s great!
901,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Ok I— I go down in the pit too.
902,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Alright, it’s cool."
903,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Wait! Make him roll!
904,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Did you just climb down or what are you doing?
905,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] No, I catch him, he’s fine."
906,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] I— I, uh, expand the Umbrastaff and use Feather Fall."
907,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah yeah yeah he Feather-Falls, that’s cool. [crosstalk] Merle?"
908,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Ok— Merle jumps...so that Magnus will catch him.
909,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh...Magnus, roll..."
910,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," A catching attack! [crosstalk] I choose you, Merle! [rolls dice] That’s a 16, I caught him!"
911,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah! Yeah, you caught him real good. Alright, uh, as, uh— [crosstalk]"
912,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] Will you rock me back and forth?
913,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk]  I used a Master Ball!
914,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Aw—
915,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, What?
916,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, As you—
917,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Wait, I have to know what he just said."
918,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, “I used a Master Ball” is a Pokémon [pronounced poké-MAN] reference.
919,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I’ve been trying to get you to fuckin’ play Pokémon my entire child, teen, and adult life."
920,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," That, and drink whiskey."
921,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. At the same time.
922,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Those are two weird things to try to get your dad to do!
923,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah. [crosstalk] Tell me about it.
924,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] ‘I just wish my dad drank more!’
925,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As you step— As you catch Merle’s weight at the bottom of the pit, you hear a loud—"
926,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I don’t catch him.
927,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," ‘Ka-chunk’— That’s not how this is— uh, you hear a loud ‘ka-chunk’ and you feel the floor of this pit drop down like, just a half-inch or so, but you all definitely feel the floor below you just, just [high-pitched] sooo slightly drop down. Nothing happens, but you feel it [very high-pitched] juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust [crosstalk] a little bit."
928,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] I drop Merle.
929,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, still fine."
930,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [beat] I pick him up again.
931,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
932,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I drop him again!
933,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Still good, still great. "
934,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [to audience] This is science, people!"
935,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah. It’s super not how science and weight works, but ok. Uh, you are all on the cobblestone floor of this pit and you felt the floor drop below you. You have a 50-foot span forward. What do you do?"
936,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, I cast… "
937,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[various thinking noises, all laugh]",
938,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, 50-foot [crosstalk] jump—
939,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Hero’s Feast!
940,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," How much did it— Yeah, right— Um, I’m just gonna start walking forward."
941,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’s fine."
942,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah I’m walking forward.
943,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Cool.
944,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m going to start walking forward.
945,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You DIE! [audience laughter]
946,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Noooo!
947,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [laughs] No, you’re fine. Yeah, you’re all fine, you all can walk to the end of this pit to where the landing is."
948,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Hey Griffin, this is a real shitty trap. Um—"
949,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter because Griffin smiled],
950,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [sarcastic] Oh, good. Thank you Travie."
951,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I like to give ‘em a little somethin’, you know."
952,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [sarcastic] Yeah.
953,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Uh… I climb up to the landing.
954,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, roll a, uh, Athletics check, Taako."
955,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s… [muttered] probably Dexterity.
956,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [beat] Probably Athletics, or Acrobatics if you wanna like, you know, acrobatically move [crosstalk] up, but use those two."
957,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Yeah, use Acrobatics, that’s good."
958,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Sweet Flips.
959,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
960,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," No, I’m— No, that’s— You’re just— That’s pandering. A 3, 8, no I got nothing. That’s three rolls in a row that would’ve failed."
961,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
962,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I was gonna go with the first one, but I’m just saying it would’ve—"
963,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, all three of you—"
964,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Do you wanna try my loaded dice?
965,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, All three of you make a Dexterity saving throw.
966,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Son of a bitch.
967,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, what?"
968,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeahhhh…
969,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Now that’s a 16 for Hoops.
970,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Ooooooh… mine is— Dex saving throw? 15.
971,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [quietly] F— fourteen. Plus… [whispered] shit…
972,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [away from mic] There, you’re there. Plus 1, plus 1. [back to mic] Plus 1."
973,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Oh, plus one? "
974,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, For fif—
975,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Fifteen.
976,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, uh, Taako, as you kind of lift your weight up off the floor as you try to climb it, the floor pops back up into place, and as it does, uh, like a million spikes, uh, eject out of the left and right walls, and all three of you just happen to be in all the right places as the spikes just shoot out around you, and then retract back into the walls as you fall off the wall and put your pressure back down on the floor."
977,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I do— I, I just wanna— I want everyone to picture this scene. We see Taako start to climb, and Merle and Magnus just step backwards, like [mimes being badass-chill]"
978,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh no no no, it’s the entire 50-foot span of the pit. You all are all—"
979,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, But we don’t get hit!
980,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah you don’t get hit by these spikes, it’s fuckin’ weird! Yeah!"
981,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Um… ok. [audience laughter] So… we live in the pit now.
982,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Griffin & Clint laugh],
983,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, What do you boys do? [beat] About the pit? [beat] It’s a bad pit!
984,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Is— Can we see any kind of, uh—"
985,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The back wall of the pit starts moving in forward towards you. [beat] Fuck you guys. [audience laughter] This is for— This is for Rascal!
986,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Clint laughs],
987,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Um, I— What—"
988,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] It’s forty— It’s 40 feet away.
989,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] What are the walls made out of?
990,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, cobblestone. It’s 40 feet away."
991,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Got it. I’m going to, uh, aim my axe at the [mumbled] breaks in the cobblestone [Griffin cackles][back to normal voice] and wedge it— I’m gonna wedge it in, in where the floor and the wall meet."
992,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Okay yeah yeah yeah, you can do that. If you do that, you’ll lose the axe."
993,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," That’s fine, I have the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword Of Doom."
994,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [beat] Ok.
995,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I have that now, I didn’t before."
996,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, rollllll—"
997,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Twenty!
998,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh oh ok, yeah that’s good. That’s the best number that there is. You use your, uh, you use the head of your axe to sort of wedge in—"
999,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s not real.
1000,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Wedge in below the, uh— the, the wall and the floor, there’s a little gap there when you drop the floor down and you can get it in there and hold the floor down."
1001,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ok, let’s climb out."
1002,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the f— the back wall is now 30 feet away."
1003,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, We’re climbing out.
1004,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," DO THE FUCKIN’ THINGS, THEN, WITH THE DICE!"
1005,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Uh, what is that, Athletics?"
1006,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yes, or Acrobatics—"
1007,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, 17.
1008,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, Taako—"
1009,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It is… 17 for me as well.
1010,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Taako and Magnus get up. It’s 30 feet away.
1011,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, ONE for Clint!
1012,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] It is a one for Clinton.
1013,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] A one-uh for Clint! A one! Numero uno!
1014,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh shit! Dad, you get like halfway up and you fall out so bad that the axe becomes unwedged and the floor pops up. Make a Dexterity saving throw WITH DISADVANTAGE CUZ YOU’RE ON YOUR BACK!"
1015,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cringes],
1016,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [beat] Can I use my grappling hook and—
1017,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughs],
1018,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I don’t know what people were cheering for, I think somebody said something very funny in the audience."
1019,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Man in the audience, “That’s your dad!”]
1020,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That’s my dad, yeah. And I’ll fucking kill him IN A SECOND!"
1021,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
1022,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," To be fair, if Griffin kills him, he becomes head of the family—"
1023,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, AND GETS ALL OF OUR RICHES!
1024,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So…
1025,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Roll again, you have disadvantage."
1026,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, DIS-advantage…
1027,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah that means you do… poorly.
1028,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a ONE!
1029,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s a one.
1030,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a ONE!
1031,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] That’s another one on that one.
1032,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] UNA!
1033,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Uh… Jesus Christ… uh—
1034,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He’s fine!
1035,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You get lit the fuck up by these spikes this time, you are not in the right place, and they just getchya all over. You take three hearts of damage— are you still alive?"
1036,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Yeah, actually. He has four hearts."
1037,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," He has one heart left, but you are prone and on the floor and in a bad sh— sh— shape and the back wall is now ten feet away."
1038,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Can I grappling-hook Merle’s arm?
1039,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [beat] His wooden arm? With a very good roll, you can. This is the last action—"
1040,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Wait! Wait, wait! It’s not your turn, is it?"
1041,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh, it’s—"
1042,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Do you just wanna die? Is that it? ’Cuz you’re rollin’ ones left and right.
1043,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, You—
1044,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Do you want someone with a hot hand to fix it?
1045,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, You and Merle’s arm are not a good combination.
1046,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s true. I mean it’s—
1047,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] I’m gonna s— Lemme say—
1048,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] Alright, fine! You know what? You can die."
1049,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Let me set the stakes! You got one more action and then you’re gonna be crushed by the wall. What do you do to save yourself in this situation?
1050,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I mean I have a magic grappling hook, but… [shrugs]"
1051,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [beat] Who are you talking to?
1052,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
1053,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Well— I—
1054,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Unless somebody else wants to get you out of there—
1055,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I climb out of the pit—
1056,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. Do it again. S—
1057,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Leaking blood like a sieve… [rolls die] Shit…
1058,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," No, tha— It’s a 14."
1059,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Total?
1060,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [beat] Yeah…
1061,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Add your Dexterity.
1062,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Oh, yeah, I have to add my Dexterity— FOURTEEN."
1063,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Can I help him?
1064,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, yes. Roll plus Strength to try to grab him."
1065,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Oh, plus Strength? Then that is a 17."
1066,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok, yeah. You reach down and pull him up just as the spikes shoot out—"
1067,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And I just stare at him.
1068,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, just barely missing your feet as the back wall comes in and crushes up against the wall and you are savvveedddddd."
1069,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience applause],
1070,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yeah!
1071,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [bratty voice] ‘Thank you, Travis.’"
1072,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, My name is Magnus!
1073,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, as you move through the door, uh, on the landing that’s sort of flanked by these torches, you see that same odd phenomenon happen again. The flames freeze and quickly the hallway that you’re entering starts to flicker and glitch out and suddenly the simulation’s just gone. And you are standing in darkness."
1074,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And then a large square of light appears on the floor in front of you and some lights overhead kick on, illuminating a stage that the three of you are standing on. Um, and in front of you is an audience of thousands of screaming fans— which I wrote here, and I realize now—",
1075,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
1076,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"I promise I didn’t think about the reality of saying that sentence out loud on this stage, um, and in front of them is a small riser where you can see a judge sitting behind a desk. And the lights are in your eyes— you can’t quite see their, their face, but you can see the title of this game as it appears in a stylish font in front of you. And the title is", Move Move Celebration!
1077,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
1078,SDCC San Diego Live Show,And the judge says [in an accent somewhere between Australian & British],
1079,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Judge," Ok, who’s gonna be dancing for us today?"
1080,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, Merle?
1081,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Merle," Well, I am pretty adept at Interpretive Jazz dance."
1082,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Which will make for some great podcasting!
1083,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, But you do have to act it out for real.
1084,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience & Clint laugh],
1085,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Are you all— are you all nominating Merle for this task?
1086,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [beat] Bring it!
1087,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I think that’s the funniest choice.
1088,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yeah, it’s a funny choice."
1089,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Ok! Uh, Merle, you step forward, the— You see this silhouette of this judge motion you towards the glowing square on the floor."
1090,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Don’t blow it. [beat] What if you only had one shot…
1091,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Ok… Merle does that.
1092,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok! As you—
1093,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Man, wouldn’t it be great if ‘8 Mile’ was a dance movie? That would’ve made that joke way funnier."
1094,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] Yeah! 
1095,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Well, every little bit helps."
1096,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, If only anybody had ever made a dance movie you could reference.
1097,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Hey, get out there and stomp the yard!"
1098,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah… uh, as you—"
1099,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You can do it, honey!"
1100,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As you ste— Oh, Jesus. Travis just made a ‘Honey’ reference during our two-thousand-and-seventeen Adventure Zone live show. Uh, as you step onto that glowing square, some blistering-fast techno music starts pounding through some massive speakers hanging overhead, and then all of a sudden there—"
1101,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, THE ECSTASY!
1102,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Griffin & audience laugh],
1103,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," All of a sudden there are glowing arrows all over you, illuminated on the floor, showing you the steps of an incredibly demanding dance. Roll— we’ve literally never used this skill before— Performance."
1104,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
1105,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Pleeeaassseeee…
1106,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He is neutral on this.
1107,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Please! [rolls dice]
1108,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It’s a 13.
1109,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Thirteen.
1110,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I don’t know why I’m reading off Dad’s numbers.
1111,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
1112,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He can read.
1113,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Are there just— are there just [crosstalk] too many—
1114,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Numbers.
1115,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I have a plus one in Performance!
1116,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Ok—
1117,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, That’s a 14.
1118,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Are there just—
1119,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, FOUR-teen!
1120,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Are there just more— There are just too many— There’s like a lot of buttons—
1121,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, There’s a lot of arrows on the floor for him to—
1122,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," And we can’t help him, right?"
1123,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You absolutely can and should help your dad.
1124,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Well, wait. Seems like if he had more legs to help him… [pause, audience laughs] If only I knew someone with four legs!"
1125,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
1126,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yeeeeesss!
1127,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, This is good.
1128,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, ARE YOU WITH US?
1129,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, This is good. I cast Phantom Steed.
1130,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
1131,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl, Yo.
1132,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [forcefully] It’s time. To dance. Let’s. Do it.
1133,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Garyl is a— if you’ve never listened— is a beautiful bi-nicorn, he’s rainbow-colored and he’s, um… I created him from my heart."
1134,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," All of a sudden, the title of the game pop up again, only this time it says ‘Dressage Dressage Celebration’. [Clint laughs] Uh Merle, roll again with advantage this time, because technically, you have double the legs as you mount—"
1135,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Triple.
1136,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Triple.
1137,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [beat] Noooo.
1138,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Not making contact with the ground, but if someone with two legs get on someone with four—"
1139,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [exasperated] Alright, roll the dice three times, you have double advantage. "
1140,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He’s gonna need it! [Clint rolls] Twelve. 
1141,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Bad!
1142,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [Clint rolls] Two?
1143,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, POOR!
1144,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Come on! Wait, use my regular dice."
1145,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Oh, this better be a good one now!"
1146,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Don’t get your funk on it! [Clint rolls] ...Twelve.
1147,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Wait, that was Travis’s dice!"
1148,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It doesn’t count.
1149,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, What the fuck?!
1150,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint & Travis," [crosstalk] TWO!! Two! Two, two!!"
1151,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Two!! Two!? Roll again!
1152,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I am trying my best. TWO.
1153,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] The audience— The audience— no, Dad, you stand RIGHT THERE— the audience boos!"
1154,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience boos],
1155,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And a wave of arrows—
1156,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, But then the audience remembers that Dad took care of Griffin—
1157,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Look what you did. Our— our [crosstalk] our elderly dad.
1158,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Come on—
1159,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Are you gonna take off your pants!?
1160,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, My belt fell off!
1161,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As the audience boos, a wave of arrows comes shooting out of the audience? "
1162,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So I don’t really have to dance.
1163,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And hits you for two hearts of damage.
1164,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, He is dead.
1165,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Merle explodes in a shower of p— [cackles] no, come back! Merle explodes in a shower of pixels and the life counter drops down to 2."
1166,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I’m assuming the arrows shoot right through Garyl, who’s just like"
1167,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl, Nice.
1168,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh yeah, he’s a phantom steed, he’s totally cool."
1169,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," But Garyl says, “I’m fine.”"
1170,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Can I do one for Garyl to see if he finishes the challenge?
1171,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yes, if your phantom steed wants to roll for themselves."
1172,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s aaaaaaaaaaaaaa 16.
1173,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the audience goes wild for Garyl."
1174,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheering],
1175,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," MVP, Most Valuable Pony Garyl. That’s a new movie with Matt LeBlanc coming out."
1176,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The audience stands up and like— uh, the judge stands up and like, cuts the audience off from their cheering and turns, and there’s a floodlight, a spotlight above that comes up and you can see their face and they’re cryyyyinnnggg. And they say,"
1177,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Judge, Garyl?
1178,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl, Yo.
1179,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Judge, I don’t know how I know your name. 
1180,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl, Mhmm.
1181,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Judge, But you’re going to HOLLYWOOD!
1182,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And he holds up a ticket! A beautiful golden ticket.
1183,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl," Hey, uhm, that sounds cool; in lieu of the ticket could I just have some oatssssss?"
1184,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and as you say that, the audience starts just throwing oats onto the stage, showering Garyl in oats, and the oats are just hitting Merle in his fuckin’ face. Just like— [demonstrating]"
1185,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Griffin and Travis laughing],
1186,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, 19 years I raised you. [crosstalk] Paid your bills. Put food on your table!
1187,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [laughing] [crosstalk] Yes I’m 19 years old!
1188,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," You know Griffin’s 30, right? Did you just check out after 19? “See me again at the liveshow!”"
1189,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, He— he set out to find his purpose!
1190,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," As the stage is flooded in oats, the scene freezes, and some of the oats freeze in mid air and it looks so cool. [Clint and Justin laugh] And then the scene dissipates and suddenly you’re back in the hallway walking out of the spike trap room, and uh, uh, Acereak pops into the chat again and says, "
1191,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Acereak," Nice moves, Garyl. Impressive."
1192,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Garyl, Thank you.
1193,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Wait, is Garyl still there?"
1194,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, no, Garyl’s not here ‘cause it was— Yeah, fuck it, yeah, sure, why not. [Justin Nice.] Uh, and then BoyDetective15 pops into the chat and says,"
1195,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Angus, Can someone ban Acereak?
1196,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"But nobody does, and you hear Lucas’s voice again and he says,",
1197,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," Listen, I— I don’t know why you keep ending up in other games but you’re really close to the end now, just keep pushing forward."
1198,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Magnus starts running.
1199,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay. Y—
1200,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Taako’s obviously riding Garyl, this isn’t even a question."
1201,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You approach a long set of stairs, and at the top see an imposing door, behind it, you’re sure, is Acererak’s chambers. The doors at the top of the stairs are [intensely] 14 feet wide, 28 feet tall, they are made of solid mythril, 3 feet thick, and impregnated— g-gross— and impregnated with great magicks in order to make them absolutely spell- and magic-proof. Fuck you, Taako. Where—"
1202,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," You slowly— you see Taako slowly put the Hole-Thrower back in his pocket, he had like, already gotten it out."
1203,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, where these doors meet at about waist-height is a cup-like depression, a hemisphero-cl-Jesus. A hemispherical concavity, uh, just stick with cup-like depression, Gary! [Clint’s laughter]"
1204,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Fucking dork!
1205,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," A cup-like depression, a hemispherical concavity with a central hole. [beat] What do you do?"
1206,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I knock on the door. Po-lite-ness.
1207,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Nothing happens.
1208,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Dam-nit.
1209,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Did we have any cups that we didn’t know about?
1210,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, No!
1211,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It’s a cup-like—
1212,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It’s a— It’s a depression in the door, there’s a little hole in the door."
1213,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, How big?
1214,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Hole-shaped.
1215,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I jam the scepter in it.
1216,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, FUCK YEAH! [audience cheers]
1217,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [unintelligible] Touch! Make ‘em touch! Touch it!
1218,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[crosstalk],
1219,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I have the scepter!
1220,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And that’s not how it is, it’s not like that. You know how it actually goes..."
1221,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [giggling] Do I?
1222,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Like the sex joke. [audience laughter]
1223,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Okay, this is a scepter, it’s not dirty! It’s a scepter into the hole!"
1224,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Uh, okay,"
1225,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] He did— he did, uh, if I may explain, ‘cause this is an audio medium— uh, Justin formed a— a circle, with the one hand, and then extended his index finger and inserted, said finger, into the circle, in a gesture, uhh uhh of insertion."
1226,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
1227,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Into a door that was already impregnated.
1228,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[uproarious audience laughter],
1229,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ok, BYE! That’s gonna do it for us—"
1230,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] The end!
1231,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Wait!
1232,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Clint giggling],
1233,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," I just wanna read how bad it could have gotten if Justin— I swear to God I didn’t think you would remember that you had gotten the scepter, uh, an hour ago— uh, if the door is attacked by force it will not budge but if it’s scratched or nicked it will turn red in that spot, and begin to gush blood. The blood of all those who have died in the tomb, the red flow will cascade down the steps and begin to fill the— it fills the fucking room"
1234,SDCC San Diego Live Show,", and then there’s like, a page of like, if you try to solve it this way, you die, if you try to solve it this way, you die, if you try to burn the blood it turns to poison gas and you die instantly. The Tomb of Horrors is fucked up.",
1235,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Did Jim Jones write this— [crosstalk] particular game?
1236,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeahh, for sure. The massive doors swing open. And you enter the demi-lich’s chamber."
1237,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Hell yeah. I think this is the perfect time here, um, to tell everyone that um, we have a graphic novel coming out."
1238,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Oh, yeah, fuck, we were supposed to do this right after we started, we’ve forgotten now twice— so, uh, before we do this next part, as you leave, uh, everybody here’s gonna be able to get a pack of the Adventure Zone gum?"
1239,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers] ,
1240,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Yeah!
1241,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and that is normally— "
1242,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," We made it just for you all, like literally just for you guys."
1243,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Yeah it’s from— it’s from our friends at First Second who are publishing the graphic novel adaptation, which you can now get— you can now get at Barnes & Noble, Amazon, or at theadventurezonecomic.com, um, and each of the packs of gum has an exclusive little comic, like a Bazooka Joe comic, starring Angus McDonald!"
1244,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheering],
1245,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"So that is— that’s for the graphic novel, it’s the first arc, The Adventure Zone"," Here There Be Gerblins, uhh which was illustrated by Carey Pietsch, who is so fucking talented [audience cheers], and that is out July 17th, 2018, and so, if you’re not here and you’re hearing this now you can preorder the graphic novel and you, uh, send your receipt, like a picture of your receipt online to theadventurezonecomic.com you can get all the Bazooka Joe comics in the gum—"
1246,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," But Dad wrote ‘em,"
1247,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Dad wrote the comics, yeah."
1248,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Dad wrote the comics, there’s— there’s three different versions you can get, one featuring Merle, one featuring Magnus, one featuring Taako, all of them have Angus in it."
1249,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," So, um, Morgan and Jeremy are gonna be out there, I think they’re in First Second shirts, uh, so everybody just please take one, pass—"
1250,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," They have big bags full of gum, they’re gonna be the only ones with big gum bags."
1251,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
1252,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, But make sure you check in with them if you’re leaving so you can go and grab that from them.
1253,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The massive doors swing shut behind you as you enter the demi-lich’s chamber, a wide red carpet leads you down from the entrance into this room, and towards a staircase that climbs five feet and up to a dais. Flanking the carpet are six stone columns, three on each side. Atop the dais is a throne, made of large, twisted bones. And the arms of the throne are capped with gold-plated iron. And sitting on that throne is a skull, and it’s completely motionless. You hear Lucas trying to communicate with you, but he’s breaking up so bad now that you can’t make out what he’s saying? Uh, and then in the lower right corner of your vision a message appears saying, “Users have been disconnected from chat.” What do you do?"
1254,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Er, I guess— [crosstalk]"
1255,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience audibly cringes],
1256,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] Nah, it’s not real!!"
1257,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] No, that’s fuckin’ scary, don’t— hey, come on!"
1258,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Hey, let t— let ‘em have their moment!"
1259,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I guess I reboot, usually."
1260,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Yeah.
1261,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, And take the cartridge out and blow in it. [blows into mic]
1262,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Yeah. Don’t do that! Oh, no— you got your spit— you gotta put your t-shirt over it and then blow through."
1263,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Oh, is that right?"
1264,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Mhm.
1265,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [strained] What do you do, aasshooles?"
1266,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I— I cast “Detect Traps” now that we’ve been through the entire thing.
1267,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, There’s no traps.
1268,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Perfect.
1269,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I shoot [murmuring] an arrow at the skull.
1270,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Rollll [murmuring] an attack roll with your bow and arrow.
1271,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [murmuring] mm, dad still has my… "
1272,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Why is everybody talking like Thurston Howell The Third?
1273,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, That’s from Gilligan’s Island.
1274,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Not great. Uh, sixteen."
1275,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That’s enough, it’s a fucking skull. Um,"
1276,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, It doesn’t dodge?
1277,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, the skull explodes in a puff of ash."
1278,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Bahbahbahbah bahh bahh ba—! [FF fanfare]
1279,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, But! But! Uh—
1280,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Bubububut butt butt but bubutt!
1281,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No! No, it doesn’t do that actually—"
1282,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, No bababahs.
1283,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," A cloud of black smoke begins to pour out of the cracks between the th— I wrote the throne bones here, which is gross."
1284,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I step behind Taako.
1285,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, and it hovers menacingly above the dais, and suddenly it starts to take form, and it forms a long tattered black robe, and as it waves about you see a half-decomposed body within. This demi-lich form though, it doesn’t have a head. But something starts to pop out of the top of the robe, [stage-whispering behind his hand] get ready on that musical cue by the wayyyyyy, [Oh Hey, It’s Hodge Podge! by Griffin McElroy starts playing] uh, taking the place that should be where the head is, it’s a computer monitor! [audience starts to cheer] And after forming, the tubes inside click on and you see a simple pixelated face appear on the screen. And a voice inside the monitor says,"
1286,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Hodge Podge," I’m Hodge Podge, the buddy-bot! [audience screams] Thanks for playing my deadly game! Didn’t you think Lucas’s training program was more enjoyable with higher stakes?"
1287,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience laughter],
1288,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Merle, [uncertainly] Yyyyyeahhh?
1289,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Hodge Podge, Congratulations on making it this far! Unfortunately you’ve reached the end of the line! Goodbye!
1290,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Let’s roll initiative.
1291,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[audience cheers],
1292,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So we get to fight some shit?
1293,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah. It’s time.
1294,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Fourteen.
1295,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," You can fade that music out whenever you want. [Oh Hey, It’s Hodge Podge! fades out quickly]"
1296,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Uh, seven for the kid. For Hoops."
1297,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Oh, I have advantage!"

1299,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, That was a four.
1300,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Good. So you get to it again.
1301,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Haha, you all doubt my prowess. [rolls] And that’s a six. [audience laughter]"
1302,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," It’s nice that you’re so consistent... -ly bad. No, I love you so much."
1303,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[Audience aaawwwws],

1307,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I rolled, uuuuuuah fourteen."
1308,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Alright. Hodge Podge is up first. Um, Hodge Podge gets two actions, on its first action it aims at… Magnus, and shoots a necrotic beam in your direction."
1309,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I am standing behind Taako, I did just say that."
1310,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Taakooooo! The beam hits youuuuu! 21? Versus AC?
1311,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Yep, that hits."

1314,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," How’s Taako doin’? Still pretty good, right?"
1315,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," I mean, he’s got one heart."
1316,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. [crosstalk] Two hearts.
1317,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," No, wait wait wait, he [crosstalk] d-d-d-d-died."

1319,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, He only had one heart left.
1320,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh yeah, Taak—"
1321,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Anyway, g—"
1322,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, Good fight everybody!
1323,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Taako explodes—
1324,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Wait, so the hearts don’t regenerate every—"
1325,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No. Taako explodes into a shower of pixels and the counter at the top of the screen now says, 1. Taako, you reappear at the center of the room—"
1326,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] That’s one more, though, so."
1327,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, next up I need all of you to make a Wisdom saving throw."
1328,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Which we’ll have advantage on, thank you Dad. [audience cheering] Thank god. I rolled an 18. Clinton rolled a Nat 20. [audience cheers wildly] He’s the SMARTEST man!"
1329,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clinton," And I just injured my shoulder, stretchin’ out like that!"
1330,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Taako, how’d you do?"
1331,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Seven, for the kid."
1332,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Taako disappears.
1333,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Ah, well. Win s— [crosstalk]"
1334,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, With advantage?
1335,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Win some, lose some."
1336,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Magnus, you’re up next."
1337,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Wait, did I lose a life, or I just disappeared?"
1338,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," No, you didn’t lose a life, just dis—"
1339,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Okay. Cool.
1340,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I— let me look at all my spell cards, umm— I’m going to attack him. With the [mumbling] Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom."
1341,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. [audience cheers] Do that shit.
1342,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[dice rolling],
1343,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," ‘S, uh, 21."
1344,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, that’ll hit this one."
1345,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," And then, uh,"
1346,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It does 20 bonus damage, I think?"
1347,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Tw— well, yeah 24… [audience member Oh my god!] total…"
1348,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It’s a very good sword.
1349,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] Very good sword.
1350,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [crosstalk] Really good sword.
1351,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [murmuring] That’s a 3, plus 24, 27?"
1352,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [out the side of his mouth] Can we top side— stop side-talking?
1353,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yeah.
1354,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Yes, TWENTY-SEVEN."
1355,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, you see three hearts float up and away from this lich form, uh, as you hit it with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom."
1356,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," And you know what, I’mma check, I’m gonna— attack it again"
1357,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Do it again, yeah. Did we talk about how— did we— have we put any limitations on the Raging— Flaming Poisoning Sword of— no, fuck."
1358,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Try it.
1359,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Alright. That’s a Nat 20. [audience cheers] [makes clicking noises] So that’s gonna be… damage twice? That’s a four—
1360,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," It doesn’t do the fuckin’, 20 extra fire damage twice though."
1361,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," I think it does. So that’s… um, 48… plus seven… ‘s 55? Damage?"
1362,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Fuck…
1363,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [laughing] It is a VERY, VERY good sword!"
1364,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You see five hearts float up and away from the lich form.
1365,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] And then I’ll use my third attack… [audience cheers] ‘S a 17, plus ten, 27?"
1366,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," That one misses, it’s fucked up. [audience laughter]"
1367,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Ah, that’s a o— ah, it’s only one damage, so 25 total. I want you to picture Magnus doing this very calmly and methodically."
1368,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, okay, two— two hearts float away, uh, from the lich, uh, Hodge Podge, and as they do, the form crumples into ash. [Justin cackling] And then, the throne of bone collapses, and the demi-lich Hodge Podge appears once again in front of you."
1369,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, I’m going to Action-Surge.
1370,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, [defeated] Jesus Christ. [audience cheers]
1371,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, And I’m gonna attack again...
1372,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, ‘Kay.
1373,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Calmly, rationally. [rolls die]  That’s a one! [laughs]"
1374,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[slow clapping from someone on the panel],
1375,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, That means a hundred and one points’a damage!
1376,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, [crosstalk] And Magnus just—
1377,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Magnus, “M’okay.”
1378,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, “Alright!”
1379,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, Taako, you’re up next [crosstalk]."
1380,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, [crosstalk] Yeah.
1381,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Taako... you were teleported away.
1382,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yeah.
1383,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," And now you’re sitting on the back of a boat on a serene lake. And joining you this time on the boat, [clears throat] is a big bass, who is sitting at the back of the boat with a big floppy hat on, and a fin on the motor, in the same position Rascal was in before? And he looks at you and he goes, [flapping noises]. And as you look around, like, this scene actually looks really fucked up? Like, the trees are upside down all around the coast, um, and there’s like, no sun in the sky, and the sky is red, and like, the water is moving in a weird like glitchy way, like there’s a wave, and then a little freeze, [Justin Okay.] and then there’s another wave— um, and the fish goes [fish noises] and motions you towards a fish and tackle box at the front of the boat, and as you look in that direction you see something poking out of the water, it’s a biiiiiiiig floppy hat, and then it’s Rascal’s face? Only it’s huuuuge. And kind of monstrous. And he screams,"
1384,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Rascal, WEEELCOME TO BIIIIIG BASSSS CHAAALLENGE!
1385,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"And splashes back down into the water, rocking your boat. Uh, and in front of you, big words appear that say, “Catch one big bass to proceed”, only the words ‘big bass’ glitch out and are replaced with the words “Rascal”. What do you do?",
1386,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[pause],
1387,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Yeah, that one I like!"
1388,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Um— mm. Yeah, [chuckles] okay, I’m going to cast Maze on Rascal."
1389,SDCC San Diego Live Show,[pause],
1390,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, I don’t know what that means but I know it’s not gonna be good!
1391,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," So, the fir— you— okay, heheh, I— "
1392,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Just describe what happens to Rascal.
1393,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, I banish Rascal to a labyrinthine demiplane.
1394,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Awwwww, not Rascal!"
1395,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," He is there until he can escape. He can use his action to attempt an escape, and, uh, if it succeeds— uh, makes a DC 20 Intelligence check— if it succeeds it escapes and the spell ends, uh, a minotaur automatically succeeds, but I assume Rascal is not a—"
1396,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, That’s a Nat 20 for Rascal! Solving the infinity maze!
1397,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Well that’s very fine but it wasn’t his turn, it was my turn. So get in the maze."
1398,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Okay. Rascal’s up next.
1399,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," Okay,"
1400,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, He rolled a Nat 20 on his—
1401,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Naahokaynahnahnahnah. [Griffin laughs] Nice try.
1402,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, that is a 19. Versus, whatever your shit is."
1403,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," It’s a— a 20. Aw, close, [sings] yet so far away. [Griffin laughs]"
1404,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, 20-ish!
1405,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," You used up that 20 magic when you— you didn’t— it wasn’t your turn. [Griffin laughs] He got to the end and was like, “I did it!” Then he was like, “Well, let’s hold on!”"
1406,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, he’s having some trouble negotiating the maze— because his body is just a big fish-body. And so it’s taking him a long time to flop around, and so now you’re just on a boat with a big fish."
1407,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, This is good. This is fine.
1408,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And the fish puts a fin— [crosstalk]
1409,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako, [crosstalk] This is fine.
1410,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, The fish puts a fin on your shoulder and goes— [fish noise]
1411,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," Hey, fins to the left."
1412,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Finish the lyric. [crosstalk] Finish the l—
1413,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, That’s— a Jimmy Buffett…?
1414,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Yep— 
1415,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Taako," I have a sore spot right here, fins to the left, a little bit more to the left— ahh, you got it."
1416,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Uh, I guess— Next in the order is Merle, back in the fight with the demi-lich."
1417,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Merle casts Guardian of Faith.
1418,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Alright. [audience cheers]
1419,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," But— but wait, there’s more. Just when the gigantic, spirit form of Della Reese— "
1420,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, Yes.
1421,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Materializes, he uses the Strongmouse Amulet [crosstalk] which allows him— which allows him to make a brilliant jape— "
1422,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Oh jesus, this is gonna tank. You can’t call your shot like this, Babe Ruth."
1423,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," [crosstalk] Why, WHY? HE TAKES LIKE 25 FREAKIN’ TURNS!"
1424,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Alright, do it. Do it, do it. What’s your joke, and again, if it fails, you’ll die."
1425,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, Well— I think we’ll leave it up to the audience to decide if it’s a great jape or not.
1426,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," Okay, wait, wait wait wait wait, this is important… don’t patronize him. If you don’t like it, just stay silent."
1427,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, It’s gotta be fair.
1428,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Hey, can we start saying that before all, all our live show jokes? “Don’t fuckin’ patronize us, only— be legit, now.”"
1429,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," It’s all I got, it’s the only— [crosstalk]"
1430,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] Alright, whatcha got."
1431,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, So this gigantic Della Reese forms in the sky—
1432,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis," [crosstalk] So hey, here’s the deal!"
1433,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] So uh, what’s the deal with all these gigantic Della Reese angels—"
1434,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," —And I say to the [chuckling] gigantic Della Reese, “TOUCH THEM, MY ANGEL!”"
1435,SDCC San Diego Live Show,"[a pause, weak cheers, a mic hitting the table]",
1436,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," [crosstalk] No, that was very loud."
1437,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," [crosstalk] No, come on, pick the mic up!"
1438,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And also not— fix it—
1439,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin," No, that was nothing."
1440,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, [crosstalk] THEY LOVED IT!
1441,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Yeah, okay, you don’t die, so what happens now?"
1442,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," I don’t remember, I just came up with it!"
1443,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Justin, Hachi machi.
1444,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," The lich Hodge Podge starts to lose its form after you hit it with this attack that it was weak to, uh, what is your joke now, Merle? What is your hot one-liner now as Hodge Podge lich starts to lose its composure in front of you, and I’m saying this because it’s almost, [intensely] 1230 in the fucking morning."
1445,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, I thou— I— I put my—
1446,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, You have one chance—
1447,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint, My touch wasn— my touch— my angel?
1448,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, No! Another one. I demand it! [audience laughter]
1449,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Clint," Uh— uhhm, m— [audience members shout suggestions] Liches get stitches. [audience uproar] [Clint giggling]"
1450,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin," Hodge— Hodge Podge’s spectral form rears up and his hands are thrown to his side and bolts of electricity starts coursing through his body, and it looks like he’s about to explode in a truly spectacular fashion, and then, your vision just turns blue and an error log pops up? And uh, through that you see Hodge Podge collapse to the floor anticlimactically. [Clint laughs] And the chat reappears with a chorus of users all saying, “GG.” And— [audience cheers] and suddenly, the three of you are awake and lying down in Lucas’s lab and you feel a uniquely unpleasant sensation as whatever device was connecting you to this virtual world detaches itself from the back of your head. And there’s Lucas, and he’s grimacing, kind of awkwardly, and he says,"
1451,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Lucas," You guys aren’t gonna let me do science to you anymore, are you."
1452,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, “Did I do that?” [Clint laughs]
1453,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Griffin, And that’s the end of the adventure! [audience screams] Today on Adventure Zone Live! Thank you all for joining us! Get your gum!
1454,SDCC San Diego Live Show,Travis, Grab your gum on the way out!
