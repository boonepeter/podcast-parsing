7,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,(part of TAZscripts on Tumblr),
8,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Griffin," Previously, on The Adventure Zone..."
9,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,"Gundren is suddenly completely engulfed in flames, and he’s growing, and, uh, bouts of flame are sort of ripping off of his body and cutting entire buildings in half. The three of you dive into the well, and then, all of a sudden, all you see is flame above you.",
10,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Travis," Well, tits."
11,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Griffin," Just a giant burst of flame. The entire town, where it used to be, you look around, and...for about a half mile in diameter, all that you can see is black glass, a circle of black glass on the ground."
12,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Travis," Well, this all sucks."
13,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Announcer," From the ashes of Phandalin, three new heroes arise. Let’s see if the Flop House gang can survive one night in...The Adventure Zone!"
14,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[theme music],
15,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,{1,21}
16,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Hey there. Welcome to The Adventure Zone. My name is Stuart Wellington, formerly of The Flop House podcast."
17,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Formerly?
18,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Did you quit?
19,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, I’m just joking. I’m a host of The Flop House podcast regularly, but I’m stepping in to be your dungeon master today. If you’re a follower of the MaxFun line of podcasts--which I’m sure you are, and if you’re not, why not?--you know that as part of the most recent MaxFun drive, we decided to do a switcheroo where the hosts of various programs are going to be taking over other programs. So the McElroys, all four of them, are going to be doing an episode of our show, The Flop House movie podcast, which is about bad movies. They’re gonna watch some terrible movie for you. Um, and we are going to be taking over The Adventure--the duties of The Adventure Zone today, investigating a different dungeon and some other dragons than the ones that you are used to on what is a semi-weekly basis. As I mentioned, I’m Stuart. I’m, I guess, the most experienced with Dungeons & Dragons and games like that. Been playing these sort of things since I was in high school, so I guess it was natural that I would take over the role of dungeon master. To my right is…"
20,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," My name is Elliott Kalan, I’m another co-host of The Flop House. I have minimal, limited experience with Dungeons & Dragons. I played it a few times in high school, and since then, Stuart had--years later, Stuart pulled me back in with some amazing adventures. I’m still--I’m very forgetful about rules often, so I’m glad that Stuart’s runnin’ the show, and I’m looking forward to once again journeying into the fantasy worlds."
21,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I’m Dan McCoy. My experience with Dungeons & Dragons is mostly that my brothers were into it, and I’m much younger than them, so I never played it with them, but I enjoyed reading the Monster Manual ‘cause I just like lookin’ at pictures of monsters. But I really don’t have any experience at all."
22,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," And I’m Zhubin Parang, occasional guest on The Flop House podcast, here brought in to help out because I have no experience with Dungeons & Dragons, but I’ve--I’ve--"
23,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You like games.
24,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I do. I’ve played board games, so I feel like it’s the same."
25,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," In fact, often I hear you say on the phone to I don’t know who, [imitating Saw] “Would you like to play a game?”"
26,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," And they always say absolutely, and we have a great hour or two playing games over the phone."
27,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughter],
28,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Phone games.
29,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So, yeah, okay. So--"
30,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," That’s from your movie, Phony Games."
31,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So what we’re gonna do now, guys, before we meet these--the new adventurers that are gonna find a--worm their way into the place of our listeners’ hearts, uh, I’m gonna set the stage a little bit. So, the three of you have been traveling together for some time. It’s up to you how long. Maybe a year, maybe five years, who knows?"
32,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, But we know each other.
33,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You know each other. Uh, you were attempting to travel to the town of Phandalin, only to find that it is a blighted ruin, has been turned into a plain of black glass, and all the inhabitants murdered. And the people who weren’t murdered, uh, which I guess were living outside the town or were trying to go there to sell stuff…"
34,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, In the Phandalin suburbs.
35,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, in the Phandalin suburbs--have been streaming away from the town in--from the ruins in droves."
36,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, The public transportation into Phandalin just cuts off right at the town border now.
37,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Cuts off right at the town border. So you had to arrange travel away from there.
38,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," There was one of those signs that we saw that says, “You’re now entering Phandalin” where someone’s painted on it, like, “only death” or, like, you know, like, “game over.” You know, like in the movies."
39,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Or, like, uh, “days since mass death event,” like, zero, like scratched--"
40,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Who goes around and paints these things? ‘Cause everyone’s dead, I don’t know, is there a guy who just roams from town to town?"
41,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, the guy who runs the paint shop is like, “Oh, great, the town died. I’m gonna be sellin’ all my paints.” So you guys, uh, you guys left that. Whatever job prospect you had there clearly has dried up. And you find yourselves in the s--uh, small town of Hogsbottom."
42,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughing],
43,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," A town famous, I mean locally--"
44,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Not a big tourist industry in Hogsbottom.
45,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Their primary industry being tanneries and butcher shops.
46,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Sure.
47,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Makes sense.
48,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Anus--
49,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The Famous Anus.
50,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Famous Anus cookies.
51,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Famous Anus pork products.
52,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Magical hot dogs.
53,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, “You gotta go to Famous Anus’s.” “I don’t think I do!”
54,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, They have a website?
55,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So Hogsbottom is currently filled to bursting with refugees of Phandalin. Uh, they’ve set up little tent towns, and you can also, as you enter the town, you see that they’re also reinforcing all the defenses. The sheriff of the town, a stout, gruff-looking dwarf by the name of Bartok Rocksplitter--"
56,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughing],
57,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Why wouldn’t he be.
58,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," --is overseeing the labors to reinforce the defenses because, as you heard along the road, there have been marauding tribes of goblins plaguing the townsfolk."
59,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Ugh, just what they need."
60,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Of course, after taking--"
61,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Is Hogsbottom, uh, ever considered an invasion threat from anybody? Would anybody ever want to invade Hogsbottom?"
62,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, you know, maybe the goblins want all the, uh, these famous hot dogs we were talking about."
63,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, I guess that’s--yeah."
64,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I could see--there’s a lot of refugees there now who might be carrying all their worldly valuables with them, so a place that was once not valuable is now a source for raiding."
65,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Exactly.
66,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Good call.
67,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, In fine leather goods.
68,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Leather goods.
69,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Goblins love leather goods.
70,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, They do.
71,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, And of course all the anuses that are ripe for eating and/or viewing.
72,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And the thing is, this year’s anus crop was a bumper one. There was a huge--if anything, there were great anuses, a great quality, and they’re worried that the price’ll actually go down because the quantity was so good."
73,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh, no, the government’s gonna have to buy it up and keep them in anus warehouses just to keep the prices--"
74,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, They had to build more anus storehouses.
75,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
76,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, They’re actually--the government’s paying farmers to burn anuses.
77,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, To burn anuses?
78,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah.
79,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Such waste.
80,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You find yourselves in the local tavern, the Laughing Maid. It is filled with gruff and--"
81,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Laughing maids?
82,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sadly, yeah, it’s clearly a misnomer, for there are no laughing maids to be found, as it is mainly filled with laborers and merchants who are kind of a little shit outta luck right now because their job prospects have dried up. Why don’t we hear a little bit about you guys? Elliott, why don’t you describe your dude?"
83,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, uh, my character, if I could introduce him, is Jeremy “Scales” Fangbattle. I’m a dragonborn bard--"
84,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Is Jeremy a family name?
85,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Jeremy is a family name, and I don’t prefer to be called by it. If you guys have been journeying with me, know that I hate the name Jeremy, and I prefer to be called by my self-given nickname of Scales, because it means both dragons and music. And that’s what I am, I’m a dragonborn, uh, descended from blue dragons--"
86,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So does that mean you’re blue? Right?
87,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I’m blue, [singing] dabadee dabadaa, dabadee dabadaa."
88,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, I didn’t even mean for that to happen.
89,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," [singing] I live in a blue house, drive a blue car, blue in this stuff, blue’s clues. So that’s how that song goes, right?"
90,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," This friendship must be constantly strained, every second of every day."
91,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Well, I’m an outlander, and I was outcast from my people mainly because of my singing. Uh, it’s--among my family--they’re a family of warriors--they don’t approve of me being a bard, and so I’m trying to win them back. Uh, so call me Scales. And they haven’t invented sunglasses yet, but if they existed, I’d be wearing them."
92,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I hope this quest finds you inventing sunglasses. I hope that’s the resolution of this quest.
93,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I mean, there’s all that glass over Phandalin."
94,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That sounds like an honest quest to have, yeah."
95,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It is, yeah."
96,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Dan, okay, what’s your dude all about?"
97,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, My dude’s name is Lucien Buttwatcher.
98,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughing],
99,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Buttwatcher is also a family name.
100,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, I don’t understand what’s so funny about that. I’m a high elf druid, hermit, and, uh, I’m searching for spiritual enlightenment, although what I’m searching for could destroy the world. So I’m not quite sure why--"
101,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The world’s most beautiful butt.
102,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, [laughing] I’m not sure why I’m searching for it other than maybe out of curiosity? Or to protect people from it.
103,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What do you look like? What’s Lucien Buttwatcher all about?
104,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I have piercing, pale green eyes."
105,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, that’s handsome."
106,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," As most elves, I am very old, but I look beautifully young."
107,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yeah.
108,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, is that a spell, or do you just age well?"
109,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Like a Tom Cruise…
110,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, I got long silvery hair, even though I’m quite young-looking. And, uh, as most elves do, I believe that elves are the best thing in the world, and we’re super great, and everyone else is not great."
111,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you guys sound--already it sounds like you guys get along really well. Okay, so we got--we got our first two heroes. Zhubin, what are you all about?"
112,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I am Tanzer Silverview of the noble family the Silverviews. Uh, Silverview is come from the legend whereby our ancestors could see silver wherever they went and thus got their riches because they were of a better class than other people. That’s a legend, that’s also the fact. It’s where our family got its money, and there’s no need to discuss it further. I have a truly scandalous secret that could ruin the family, on an unrelated note. And I am--"
113,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Seems like an interesting thing to offer up.
114,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It’s completely unrelated to what I said earlier. I am...I believe inherently that I am better than others because of my higher class, but I’m also very--I feel very burdened by my family name, and I want people to know that I’m independent of it. But also part of it, because I get a lot of prestige that way. And again, Silverviews--"
115,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sure.
116,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Come from viewing silver. Legendary and fact.
117,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So, yeah, what are you guys doing all together? What are you guys adventuring together for?"
118,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, well, I--"
119,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What brings you together?
120,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, I relate to Mr. Silverview’s issues with his family."
121,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sure.
122,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Lord Silverview.
123,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Lord Silver--and I also see the lord as a possible patron, perhaps. Of mine music. Uh, Buttwatcher, I’m not sure exactly what you’re doing with us."
124,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh, though I’m a hermit, in my meditation, I received what I believe to be a vision that tells me that if I really want to seek this spiritual enlightenment and this cosmic truth, I need to leave my hermitage and go along with these adventurers."
125,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, possibly it’s tied in with this, uh, Silverview and, uh, Scales, was it?"
126,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Scales!
127,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Scales.
128,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, despite my cool name, which might sway you, I’m actually kind of a grimace type. I think--"
129,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Wait, but I thought he was purple."
130,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, he was--I’m blue, but, uh, I--dabadee dabadaa, dabadee dabadaa--"
131,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," We can edit this out, right?"
132,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, --that--I believe Scales Fangbattle might get us into a bit of trouble once in a while.
133,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sure.
134,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Do not edit out my blue song.
135,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, [laughing] Okay.
136,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I’m between my fifth and sixth year in Silverview University. I’m having my sort of just out and about year, I’m young, I’m handsome, I’m rich, and I’m just out and about, having a good time and also hoping that maybe I can make a name for myself."
137,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, like I did in between my years at Silverview University."
138,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, yeah."
139,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Gonna nail some broads. Maids.
140,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, I assume that’s the code that he’s using."
141,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, That’s a hundred percent what I was using. And what I’ll be pursuing throughout this quest.
142,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. So speaking of a quest, you guys are in the Laughing Maid, and you guys are getting a lot of stares. In addition to being kind--outlandish-looking, you also have the look of adventurers about you. You’re not the drab, dour commoners that surround you."
143,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, come on! I’m not drab, I’m blue! Dabadee dabadaa, dabadee dabadaa--"
144,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I suggest we go to a different bar. This is kind of drab, it’s weird, it’s sad, there’s probably some sort of cocktail lounge somewhere? Someplace we can really kind of stretch out. What do you guys say?"
145,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," For the more perceptive members of the crew, you realized that there were no other bars in Hogsbottom."
146,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I’ll say, uh--"
147,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, I’m pretty sure I saw one two blocks down. Let’s just go back out and we’ll walk around.
148,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Come on, guys. This place is fine. I don’t mind being--I don’t mind getting attention. In fact, it’s [singing] preferable!"
149,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[groans],
150,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," [singing] That maybe they look, and they see...at us...where’s my lute? Hold on. I gotta--I misplaced my pack. I gotta get it."
151,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," As an elf, I listen to the music of the spirits, and your song disturbs and annoys me."
152,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So as you guys are arguing about this, a young, kind of doughy, pasty-faced man with thinning hair and a doublet bearing a symbol of a barrel with an apple on it--the symbol of a local ciderworks, the Tapwell Ciderworks--approaches you with his hands up, and he says,"
153,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Man," I hope you’re not planning on leaving, adventurers."
154,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Well--why, of course no! Nooo! Come on, join us! Yeah! What’s your name?"
155,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Man, My name is Augustus Tapwell. Perhaps you’ve heard of my family’s cider fortune.
156,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I have heard of the cider fortune. The Tapwells, yeeeees, and I’m clearly stumbling, to say--just trying to pretend that I know what he’s talking about, I...we all know. I’m Silverview, so we obviously know each other. We’re both rich men of esteem. Where’s a cocktail lounge that we can come to?"
157,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus," I...I don’t know what a cocktail lounge is, but you can get a pint of ale here, m’lord."
158,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Ugh. All right. I’ll get a pint of ale here. There’s no other way around this.
159,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus," Wait, let me buy that for you. But first, my--my father has a proposition for you three adventurers."
160,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, All right...
161,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, All right?
162,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I’m hoping some kind of Broadway show? Perhaps starring us?
163,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He puts his arms around you and kind of bundles you over to a table in the corner, past the onlookers that are crowding around the other tables."
164,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Hmm.
165,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," This corner table, though able to accommodate multiple people sitting at it, only has two people, two places set currently. One is a very old man, and the other is a nearly identical doughy young man to the one that is currently pushing you over to the table."
166,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Mhm.
167,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The old man--both of those men are wearing almost identical doublets with the Tapwell logo, and they are digging into a supper in front of them. You are ushered to grab a seat while he orders three tankards of ale from a passing barmaid."
168,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Is she laughing?
169,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, She is not laughing. She is way too--she’s in the weeds right now.
170,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh, that’s terrible."
171,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, She has nothing to laugh about.
172,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," You think perhaps a song would cheer her up, or should we focus on the--you know, let’s focus on what we’re doing right now."
173,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I start eating.
174,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[Stuart laughs],
175,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I start just going right away and eating.
176,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Just eating from their plates?
177,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, From their plates. I have no concern about it.
178,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The old man says,"
179,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Old Man, I like a man with--clearly a large appetite. The three of you have the look of seasoned adventurers.
180,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, You have a good eye. You’re--we are. We’ve explored the Mountains of Destruction not six weeks prior.
181,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Old Man, I haven’t heard of it. Perhaps the three of you can have a seat. My old man ears can’t hear you so well.
182,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, sure."
183,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Were we not sitting already? You were just eating standing up from his plate?
184,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Standing up.
185,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," You’re an inferior race. I’m over one hundred years old, yet my ears are as strong as ever."
186,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Guys, we are being very insulting right now. Perhaps there’s an adventure in this? With, perhaps, money? And I--per--I’ve talked to you guys about this in the long nights on the road, but I have a huge desire to provide children for my clan through the doing of women. We’ve gotta find them."
187,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sadly, there’s no women at this table. It’s just you and two, uh, middle-aged men, and one very old man."
188,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," But he’s got these two sons, I assume, so, like, let’s--there’s got--I mean, we know--so maybe he’s got daughters elsewhere, too."
189,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s probably got a wife that created those sons. Let’s find out.
190,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, You can do her.
191,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, I mean, she’s probably beyond child-bearing age, but I’ll figure it out. "
192,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, A small chance is better than no chance. I sit down.
193,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Old Man, My name is Ambrose Tapwell. Perhaps you’ve heard of my cider fortune.
194,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Yes, we’ve been through this."
195,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," As of late, not two nights past, my mansion house, orchard, and ciderworks were attacked by a marauding band of goblins."
196,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Mm. Goblins.
197,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, The worst.
198,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Stupid goblins.
199,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Luckily, my retainers sprang into action and hustled me and my family to safety, however allowing my home to be overrun by these creatures."
200,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Mm, it’s a real {toe to hall? 1755} type situation. "
201,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," He said, referencing a book that didn’t exist in this universe."
202,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Now, in the--"
203,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Seems to me we need to hear the goblins’ side of the story, but go on."
204,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," They have no side! They’re goblins, and I hate them. Now, in the hustle and bustle, I was not able to take all of my possessions, and I was hoping that I could find some strong and, well, learned types, experienced types in the ways of adventuring, such as yourselves."
205,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Mm-hmm.
206,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," To break into my home and retrieve an item for me. I would be willing to pay you, although I think the knowledge that you’ve done a good deed should be payment itself."
207,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," This home, what’s it like? Is it a typical shack that seems like it would be easy to break into, or are we talking more of a fortress sort of thing?"
208,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, He referred to it as a mansion house.
209,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Oh, okay."
210,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," It’s a simple manor house. It would be easy to get into. In fact, the--I would assume the goblins may have already gotten bored and left. Otherwise, you’ll have to sneak past or murder them."
211,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, sounds like a pretty easy job. I mean, it would work great as verse 277 of the epic song I’ve been writing about our adventures. I embroider a little bit, but, you know, I’ll probably double the number of goblins."
212,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," As long as you’re not singing the first 276 verses as we’re going through, I think we could easily get through this."
213,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," In fact, I can do that just for you! [singing] Oh, hear a story of three friends true, one of them blue, dabadee dabadaa, dabadee dabadaa..."
214,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Three and a half hours later,"
215,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Wow, that was a gripping story. Mr. Ambrose, I--"
216,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, It was amazing.
217,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, It was mostly of the color of the dragonborn.
218,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I mentioned some of the stuff we fought.
219,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, It has a melody that I find catchy and yet incredibly irritating.
220,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, yeah, it’ll stick with you for days. Now, about this house and the job therein, uh, you mentio--I love doing things for the good of them, but you did mention that you would hire us for, I assume, a fee of some kind."
221,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Well, yon lizard man, you drive a hard bargain."
222,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, And I will ignore the racism of that remark.
223,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," I’m willing to offer you--a pittance to lordly folks such as you, but how about 75 gold pieces each?"
224,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, We try and contain our excitement.
225,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Yes, a pittance."
226,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," It’s very little, but you know, we’re not doing it for the money. It’s, yeah..."
227,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, It would cover another year at Silverview...
228,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, That is totally a pittance to you. You wipe your ass with 75 gold pieces.
229,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You’re super rich!
230,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," You guys, I only got 10 gold pieces on me. That’s, uh, that’s--"
231,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Now, I’d hate to--I’d hate to insult you, so I’d be willing to give you 25 each up front."
232,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, yeah, it’s, uh...should we..."
233,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Guys, I could--"
234,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Should we haggle for some more? What should we do? The whole thing up front?
235,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, I could just give each of us...
236,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," So, we have an accord? Do we need to fill out paperwork, or is a gentleman’s agreement appropriate?"
237,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Well, our families obviously are of the same class. I see no reason for paperwork."
238,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He is nowhere near your class.
239,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, I’m amazed you feel that way.
240,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s a fuckin’ cider merchant.
241,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I do not--I’m very ignorant as to noble--
242,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, Are you making fun of me?
243,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," No, no, he’s very stupid."
244,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I assume people, when they say they’re of a high class, are, and so I believe our families should--should agree to a gentleman’s agreement."
245,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Um, so I’ve added, by the way, 25 gold pieces to my stash. I’m already on board."
246,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He says, Now, to give you a bit of information, my home is about a day’s travel from Hogsbottom. The item in question is located inside a chest buried in the Northeast corner of my cellar. "
247,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Northeast corner of the cellar.
248,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, It’s not a particularly heavy chest. One of you strapping adventurers could carry it without much trouble. 
249,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, It’s what--it’s--so it’s not that big.
250,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Uh, no."
251,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, And what’s in it?
252,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," If you must know, there’s, uh, important documents."
253,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Do you want the chest too, or just the documents?"
254,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Uh, the chest, please. It also has personal effects."
255,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Okay. Probably an heirloom or something.
256,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," This does not seem suspicious, and I take it at face value."
257,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Now, if you--I could give you directions, or if you insist, you could take one of my two sons with you. I care not which, but you must leave me one, for I need to have an heir."
258,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Don’t worry. We don’t want to bring both of those guys with us. Both of the Pillsbury dough twins.
259,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They both look at you kind of nervously, fearing goblins."
260,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Hmm. Should we bring either of these two guys? They--it would help us find the way faster.
261,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," And if we get attacked, we can push one of them..."
262,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, That’s true.
263,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, That’s a very good point.
264,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Cannon fodder.
265,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, It looks like they could absorb a lot of goblin darts.
266,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, All right. We’ll take...we’ll take whichever one of your sons you care for the least. You choose.
267,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re having trouble remembering which one talked to you in the first place.
268,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I’m sure it was...that guy…? Ugh, why did they both have to sit down?"
269,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He says,"
270,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," Uh, whichever one of you finishes your dinner first doesn’t have to go. "
271,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And the two of them dig in with a, uh, abandon that is almost frightening."
272,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Do I take out my lute and play some dinner-eatin’ music? You know I do! [guitar noises]
273,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, And this was the invention of the eating contest.
274,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You guys are seeing all of history today. Uh, of course, so it turns out that Archie Tapwell is going to be accompanying you. He looks very disappointed. Luckily for you, despite the fact that this town is full and it sounds like the--that the hotel is full as well, the inn that you’re in, the inn of the Laughing Maid, I think I mentioned that. Tapwell actually makes sure there’s a room set aside for the three of you to sleep in. So I’m assuming you...go right to bed immediately, or do you go about drinking and whoring away that 25 gold pieces you just got?"
275,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Hmm, I do have 25 new gold pieces."
276,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I tipped 25 gold pieces to the bartender, so I already lost the money. I care for it that little."
277,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Should we just go to bed and get on with this adventure?
278,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You are treated very well. At first, he thinks you’re punking him, and he looks around for a video camera. He realizes you’re not, and then he decides that he’s going to close the bar the next day forever and go away."
279,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh god, I shut down…"
280,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’ve destroyed the economy.
281,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Well, I don’t need sleep. I only need to meditate for four hours. But sure, why not?"
282,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
283,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Do you sit over them, watching them?"
284,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah.
285,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Creepy, but it’s never not been creepy. We’ve been together for a long time."
286,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I take the prettiest girl there to bed with me and spend the night.
287,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, they are disappointing."
288,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I do it all the same.
289,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Hogsbottom is not famous for the girls, after all."
290,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It was that easy? We can just say it?
291,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, well, I mean, there…"
292,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I go up to them, and I say, “I’m Silverview…”"
293,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, A charisma check?
294,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, let’s do a charisma check on this one. I’m assuming we’re gonna use persuasion?"
295,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Persuasion…
296,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you know what, because you are clearly nobility, I’m gonna give you advantage on this die roll."
297,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Fantastic.
298,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you’re gonna roll two dice and pick the highest.
299,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Okay. So what I do is I walk up to a girl, and I say,"
300,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Excuse me, I’m Tanzer Silverview, of the Silverviews. Here’s my room key. [dice rolling] I get a 20?"
301,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, man! So you take the--so you just rolled a 20. Now, 20’s the best thing you could possibly roll. This woman goes to the bedroom that you share with your two friends."
302,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Well, two can play at this game, says--"
303,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I creepily watch while meditating.
304,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, --says Scales.
305,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Two can play at this game, and I need to provide children for my tribe. Time to impregnate one of these dull barmaids."
306,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So I go up to the one that’s left--I assume there’s probably not more than two--
307,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Now, sadly, there’s only two left, and this one is, uh, this one is a little grumpier. You’re gonna have disadvantage on this die roll."
308,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh boy, that sounds so great."
309,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you roll two dice and take the lowest.
310,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. [dice rolling] I rolled a 20. Oh, no, lowest, which is an 8. But I have a +3 to charisma, does that help?"
311,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That’s true, and do you have persuasion, I think would be the appropriate skill?"
312,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I do not have that as a skill.
313,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Hmm, so you’re not as charming as you assume you are."
314,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I do have performance, though. Could I perhaps sing her a song, I’m the piano dragon. Except it’s a lute. She rebuffs me, but then I pull out my lute…"
315,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, she rebuffs you, you pull out your lute, and she continues rebuffing you. And unfortunately, it doesn’t look like you’re gonna get lucky tonight."
316,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Aw, too bad. Okay."
317,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’ll have to wait ‘til the next day when you roll again.
318,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," So I’ll just go up to our room and watch my friend Tanzer have sex. Or try to sleep while he’s, I assume, sharing a bed with me."
319,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, it’s just one giant bed. That’s how they did it in D&D."
320,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I rolled a 20, so the sex goes on for hours. Hours and hours, all night."
321,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You’re gonna have to roll a separate roll, but we’ll do that when we’re not recording. Um, well, that’s been great. Let’s just keep rolling to see if we seduce ladies for the rest of the day."
322,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, fine, I stop off to bed."
323,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," We’re still in the tavern, guys. We’re getting off to a roaring start at this situation."
324,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Let’s skip to--is there some way we can go to sleep and skip to tomorrow?
325,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sure. So the next morning, you wake up to the crowing cock."
326,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Of Tanzer.
327,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uhh, ye adventurers three, and Archie Tapwell--"
328,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Probably because he’s picked up an STD of some kind.
329,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, you set off for the Tapwell--"
330,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Archie wasn’t in the room with us, was he?"
331,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, he was--he was sharing a bed with his dad and his brother."
332,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Everyone heard. Everyone in the tavern heard. I gotta go to a pharmacy. I am burning.
333,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, An apothecary.
334,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, I think the apothecary in D&D. So you guys, uh, you guys set off. I’m assuming you’re traveling by road, unless you wanna travel over land, uh, following the river."
335,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Is one way quicker than the other?
336,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uhh...does any, uh, any of you guys wanna make a survival--do you guys have high survival? [pause] It’s a wisdom…"
337,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I mean, I have--survival’s one of my talent’s that I’m proficient in, I guess."
338,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I have wisdom, but I do not have survival."
339,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You can’t take care of yourself.
340,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, No.
341,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, should I--"
342,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I have book smarts.
343,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You can try and lead them over land if you’d like, but there’s a chance it would slow you down as you lead them astray."
344,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And you know what? I don’t know the way anyway, ‘cause Archie’s the guy who’s leading us, so why don’t we stick to the road?"
345,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you travel by road.
346,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Until we get to the house, there’s probably no need to start hiding, right?"
347,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you probably don’t need to hide. Unless you’re fearing an ambush?"
348,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Which I’m not.
349,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re not fearing an ambush.
350,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You don’t fear anything.
351,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, No.
352,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Anyone who has fear in their lives would not have had sex with that barmaid.
353,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I have the whitest, gaudiest horse in all--"
354,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You have no horse.
355,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I have no horse?
356,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You have no horse at all. You traded your family horse for, I’m guessing, your, I don’t know, uh...you gave your horse away as a tip, I would imagine. Assuming you’ll get another one."
357,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I bring it up a lot, though, that I used to have a very fancy horse."
358,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Beautiful horse.
359,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What was the name of your beautiful horse?
360,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[crosstalk],
361,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, what was the name of your horse?"
362,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, it, uh, it was, uhh...it was, um, Clops-a-Lot."
363,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
364,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, and it w--"
365,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Named as a child.
366,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Named as a child. 400-year-old horse. Been through generations of the family.
367,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, His defining characteristic’s right there in the name. That’s convenient.
368,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
369,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you guys travel for most of the day. I’m--you probably take a brief break to eat some trail rations?
370,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Sure, sure. I gotta practice my lute."
371,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you, I guess, enjoy the scenery, as it is late--it’s late autumn. You can tell that Tapwell’s annoyed that his--uh, his son Archie explains that part of the reason they’re so frustrated is that these goblins scared off whatever workers were going to be picking the apples to prepare for this year’s cider crop, which is what their fortune is based on. [clears throat] After traveling for most of the day, the sun is starting to set when you are able, uh, when Tapwell manor comes into view. Tapwell manor is a plot of land that’s divided in the middle with a, uh, creek, a stream. On one side is a two-story manor house done in a somewhat modern fashion. Sitting next to the manor house is a stable. Opposite the creek is the large orchard that you can tell is what the ciderworks comes from."
372,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Source of the Tapwell billions.
373,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep, the zillions."
374,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I’m slowly starting to realize the family’s not as rich as I imagined.
375,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There, uh, there’s also--on the side of the orchard, there’s also a two-story building with a water wheel that you’re assuming is where the cider is made."
376,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Mm, the ciderworks."
377,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There’s a low, stooped ceiling building that you can only imagine is where the lo--the workers have to sleep when they’re working. You know, working at the orchard. Uh--"
378,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, That’s where they would follow the cider house rules.
379,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, There is a-- [laughs] I was waiting how long it was gonna be before you made a joke about that. Not long.
380,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Did your character make that joke?
381,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, yeah, he did. But nobody understands it. I assume that--"
382,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, That’s the second time you’ve done something like that. You must have some sort of future perception.
383,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I live in a rich fantasy world that happens to bear an amazing resemblance to the world that we live in as real people.
384,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So the entire--the entire estate is protected by a simple, like, double log fence. And the grounds, the woods’ve been cleared away from the grounds itself. The woods kind of inch up all the way up to the fence. So it isn’t--wouldn’t be that hard for you to sneak up to the fence."
385,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Is there a gate?
386,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There is an open gate--there’s no gate, there’s just an arch."
387,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, okay. "
388,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sitting in front of that arch, you can see quickly collecting flies is the corpse of a horse lying in the middle of the road. Uh, which, when Archie sees that, he stiffens. And hanging above that--"
389,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Wait, like, in fear, not in, like...arousal."
390,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He is not aroused at all. He is not into that.
391,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I don’t know what they do out here in Hogsbottom.
392,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He likes living horses.
393,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So he’s into living horses.
394,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So, and hanging above that horse from the, uh, the arch that says “Tapwell Farms” on it is, uh, looks like a pair of human-shaped bodies swinging in the wind with arrows sticking out of them with bags on their heads."
395,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Oooh.
396,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Now, the, uh, to further describe the thing you’re seeing, uh, you can also see a single stream of smoke gently flowing out of the chimney of the manor house."
397,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Oh! Cozy.
398,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You, and, uh, you also see some shadows out in the orchard that you can only assume are goblins, as well as three figures digging over by, uh, just behind the manor house. They’re digging right by a tree that overhangs the property. There’s three of them, they’re digging with shovels, and there’s--from the mounds of earth, it looks like they’ve been digging for quite some time."
399,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Hmm.
400,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you can see a single, lone figure dressed in rusted and tattered armor carrying a spear patrolling the--slowly going in a circuit, patrolling the fence, standing next to--walking next to a mastiff hound."
401,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Is he alone?
402,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He’s--yep. Well, except for the mastiff hound."
403,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Do any of us have any idea what that sphere might be?
404,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[pause],
405,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sphere?
406,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah.
407,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What sphere?
408,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That the guy had.
409,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Spear. Spear.
410,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, spear. I thought you said sphere. So it’s not a magic thing."
411,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s carrying a magic sphere!
412,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I thought--I don’t know, it’s Dungeons & Dragons!"
413,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, I probably meant--I probably said sphere when I meant spear.
414,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, spear."
415,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, I’m getting so excited that you’ve just gotten to the goblins.
416,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, So does anyone have any idea what that spear might be? Is that a magic spear?
417,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, I think it’s probably a spear of some sort. A pointy stick.
418,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Can I ask something as, uh, as a human? Newbie?"
419,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let’s take a pause, Dan. What’s goin’ on?"
420,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, A hubie.
421,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Now, to do, like, a perception check, like, what does that do that just, like, seeing something doesn’t do?"
422,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, so basically you would be saying, “I wanna be--I wanna examine something in a little more detail,” and we would either say--perception is kind of more of a passive thing. Investigation is probably a little better."
423,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Right.
424,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," But, uh...it--perception is something that I would have you check, uh, that I would kind of determine you would roll. So it would be in case you might miss a detail."
425,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Can one of us look at that hole that they seem to be digging and see what’s…
426,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Seems like it’s on the far end of the property.
427,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," From your angle, you’d have to get a little bit closer."
428,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Hmmmm…
429,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I’m guessing...should we send Archie to go look at that horse and see if it’s a trap?
430,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You can also see tied up next to the--you can see tied up next to the building with the water wheel, there’s a flat barge that they clearly use to transport kegs of cider all the way back to Hogsbottom. Downriver."
431,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," So that’s a good escape thing, maybe."
432,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, And that’s just sitting there idle?
433,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, it’s tied up."
434,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, The goblins haven’t--
435,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The goblins haven’t--
436,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, --corrupted the business.
437,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, haven’t turned it into a party barge yet."
438,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Into the beast, just drivin’ around. Sellin’ people drinks while they blast music."
439,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Jerks.
440,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Make more profit than apples ever did. I don’t know why we don’t just let the goblins have it.
441,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I say we...maybe we should send Archie to investigate the horse? Draw the attention away from the--
442,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, And then we sneak in the other direction.
443,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," We gotta get to the basement of the house, that’s where the stuff is."
444,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," We gotta get rid of that guard first, right? So I wonder if he draws the attention of the guard, we then can kill the guard."
445,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, What if we sent him to go talk to the guard? And see if we can find a way in.
446,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I would like to sacrifice Archie for a more valuable purpose later on. Like, right now, all three of us can take the guard. He’s--"
447,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," --by the way, I’m whispering this loudly enough for Archie to hear."
448,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s getting increasingly more nervous. Although he still kind of zones out every once in a while and starts looking at stuff around.
449,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," We can easily kill the guard. I say we kill the guard, have Archie walk ahead of us, set off any traps…"
450,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, We’d have to kill him fast enough that it would not raise an alarm.
451,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," And quietly, and there’s a dog with him. Now, I could--I don’t--now, my lightning breath is not powerful enough to kill both of them in one blast. If only it was."
452,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," I have something called Fog Cloud, which creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range, which maybe we could use to sneak in."
453,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, And who would suspect a moving cloud of fog?
454,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Well, it doesn’t move. It stays in one place."
455,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, I see."
456,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, But that would be great.
457,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, So should we sneak around the guard?
458,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, But it’s starting to get darker. It’s--you know--
459,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," So, yeah..."
460,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, So should we sneak around the guard and just walk up to the fence?
461,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, We could try.
462,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, I--yeah, let’s try it, why not."
463,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, All right.
464,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We’ll do a stealth--
465,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you wait for the guard to kind of walk past, and then you…"
466,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yes.
467,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The--okay. Now, are you guys, uh, are you guys gonna try and sneak up toward the gate? Like the front, or are you gonna try--are you gonna try a direct--"
468,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," How far is the gate from the house? Like, is the house--"
469,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s about 60 feet.
470,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. ‘Cause if, like, is there a point in the fence that’s closer to the house? Could we try to, like, climb over part of it and get to the house? We could have less distance to cover?"
471,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, There’s not a part of the--the closest spot is the--is the gate.
472,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The gate? Okay.
473,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And also, uh, you can also possibly wait for the guard to be obscured by the stables. Or the house."
474,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," And at the angle we approached, the--the goblins are--they’re digging, will not see us?"
475,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You could approach at an angle where the goblins wouldn’t see you. Those goblins.
476,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Do we wanna inve--yeah, there’s goblins probably everywhere."
477,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, That’s a good point.
478,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Lousy with goblins, probably."
479,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Goblins all around. Uh, so would, uh, do we wanna investigate that hole? I mean, we got--let’s just go to the basement and get that stuff. We’re not being--look, I’m all about the good stuff and doing good things for people, but we’re not being paid to--to save his house from goblins."
480,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, No.
481,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, He wants that chest full of documents.
482,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Now, my character would risk too much to uncover lost knowledge. I don’t know whether what’s in that hole counts. I mean, I don’t think it’s, like, an ancient artifact or some snatch of scroll or something, but I wonder whether I’m extra curious about it."
483,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, it sounds--there’s three goblins are entranced with this digging of a hole."
484,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Keep in mind, my fl--my flaw is that violence is my reaction to every challenge, so I’m also kind of itching to fight a bunch of goblins. Uh, but I’m j--I wanna keep my eyes on the prize here, and the prize is that chest in the basement."
485,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Archie seems to support this, you guys kill the goblins, but he also doesn’t wanna be ri--he doesn’t wanna risk himself."
486,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Mhm. So he would supervise the killing of the goblins?
487,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He would appreciate it, yeah."
488,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Well, if those three goblins are alone, then, yeah, let’s walk up and try to see if we can kill those three goblins and see what’s in that sweet hole. I think at the very least--"
489,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We’ve already been so quickly distracted from our--
490,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Wait, you said something about a hole."
491,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," We gotta go--we gotta go fill that hole back up, right? Is that our mission?"
492,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Or should we go--or should we just go st--try to--
493,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you got a lot of goblins are digging holes all over the--"
494,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," What if we wait for the guard to go around where he can’t see us, we go at an angle where the goblins digging the hole can’t see us, and we try to make a break for the gate and get to the house."
495,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, All right.
496,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, We can run for it.
497,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, We’ll deal with that hole later on. That hole’s getting looked at at some point.
498,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Oh no.
499,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, We’re definitely checking out that hole.
500,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I think, uh...was it Lucien?"
501,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah.
502,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Lucien Buttwatcher has an interest in holes, so what we’re gonna do...we’re gonna see it…"
503,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," All right, so we’ll do that."
504,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I don’t get your jokes.
505,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, okay, so you guys are gonna wait for him to pass, and then you are gonna creep up stealthily? On the house?"
506,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yes.
507,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so that’s--now, what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna do a group check to see how stealthy you are. Are you going to bring Archie with you? Or are you going to leave him in the woods?"
508,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, He seems like the sort of guy who would just stumble over his own feet.
509,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah. Is there a way we can send him over to the hole? And ask him to take a look and see if, uh, although, I guess, again, it’s--we don’t wanna sacrifice him for nothing. Do we--can we leave him somewhere as a lookout? I don’t know how useful that would be. Seems...he tends to go into fugues where he just stops paying attention."
510,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You can do whatever you want, you just gotta tell him what to do."
511,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I wonder if it’d be worth--
512,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He seems pretty amicable to you guys, being that he’s talking to a dragon man, an elf, and a guy who’s above him stations-wise."
513,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So he’ll do pretty much whatever we tell him.
514,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yeah.
515,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," But he knows the woods presumably better than we do, so I’m wondering if we can…"
516,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He knows the--I mean, he also knows the house that he lives in better than you do."
517,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, so I feel like--so he probably is more benefit with us in the woods than--"
518,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, let’s take him with us."
519,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay! Big mistake, you guys lost the adventure."
520,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Nooooo!!
521,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Nah, I’m just joking, the game’s still going. So what we’re gonna do now is we’re gonna do a group check. To do a group check, everybody rolls a stealth check, and we need--I need the majority of you guys to successfully pass the--against the target number. So to roll a stealth ta--check, you are gonna roll, I believe that is a...dadadadada...is a dexterity?"
522,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yes.
523,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, and if you’re proficient in stealth, add +2 to whatever your dexterity and die roll is."
524,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, I have a +2 to dexterity, but I am not proficient in stealth."
525,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That’s fine, just roll your--you just get your dexterity bonus."
526,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Oh, no."
527,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
528,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," 16, 19."
529,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Oof...that was bad. I’m gonna reroll ‘cause mine hit the microphone.
530,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, That doesn’t count--it still counts.
531,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, boy."
532,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So what’s your total, guys?"
533,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, 5. Ugh."
534,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I got a 5 plus 2, so 7."
535,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, 7?
536,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I got a 3 plus 2, so 5."
537,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I’m 19.
538,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You are amazing. You are 19.
539,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I carefully walk into the woods while you guys are felling trees behind me.
540,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, so what happens is, as you guys--"
541,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I stumble over my lute strings.
542,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, As you guys are creeping--
543,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [string plucking noises]
544,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, This has never happened to me before. I am a master of the woods and nature.
545,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, as you guys are creep-- [laughs] as you guys are creeping up, you’re passing the corpse of the horse when the blanket of flies that is covering the horse erupts in a cloud, and Archie goes,"
546,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie, Aaaahhhhh!!
547,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, thanks, Archie."
548,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Archie!
549,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, They’re just flies.
550,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Now in that moment of terror, because there--you realize that you may have, uh, attracted the--the goblins, I want all of you guys to make a perception check. [dice rolling] The sound of dice rolling."
551,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, 12. Is that with the wisdom?
552,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep, it’s plus your wisdom bonus."
553,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, so I have 16 plus 1, 17."
554,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," 13 plus, I’ve got 4, uh…"
555,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so 17."
556,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, 17.
557,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, 12.
558,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I don’t know how to do math.
559,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay--
560,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Simple arithmetic.
561,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Literally the simplest.
562,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so who was in the lead?"
563,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [quietly] You’re doing great.
564,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Who was in the lead of your little group?
565,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I assume I was, ‘cause I was the only one not tripping over everything as I was walking past."
566,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So which of you guys was then in the--in the marching order?
567,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, I think I was next."
568,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay. So you notice--you’re totally oblivious to this.
569,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Okay.
570,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You notice, uh, you notice the curtains shift in the second floor of the house."
571,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ohh.
572,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Somebody has taken notice.
573,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Somebody’s up there and sees us.
574,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And Dan, you notice, as you guys are passing under the arch, that those bodies of people that have been shot with arrows look a little bit weird. And as you investigate, you realize that they’re just, uh, dummies stuffed with straw."
575,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Aww.
576,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Hmm.
577,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, These might be nicer goblins…? Than we thought…?
578,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And the blood is smeared cherries all over their chests.
579,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Wait a minute, did we stumble into a haunted house?"
580,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, What are you guys talking about? Let’s keep going.
581,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Hey, there’s somebody in the second f--I’m whispering-- [whispering] There’s somebody in the second floor of the house that looked at us through a curtain. Did you notice anything, Buttwatcher? Some butts or something?"
582,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I noticed that those corpses are an even lower form of life than not elves.
583,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, In that--
584,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, They’re just straw people.
585,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Okay, so something seems amiss about this."
586,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," So, uh, we turn on Archie, right? Archie’s gotta know what the fuck’s going on."
587,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I mean, there’s still--we see that--"
588,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," [overlapping] He’s like,"
589,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie," Whooooa, what?"
590,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, That’s true.
591,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," He’s just got scared by a cloud of flies, and there’s a ton of goblins."
592,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Archie, look at these damn scarecrows."
593,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie," Uh-h-h-h, I don’t--I don’t know, the goblins must’ve put ‘em here."
594,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Maybe we should get--find cover somewhere since I think we’re just standing at the--at the arch right now?
595,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yeah?
596,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, do you wanna, like…"
597,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Let’s run to the cover of the woods?
598,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Duck inside the gate, or…?"
599,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Or run away, I like these suggestions."
600,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Gotta get outta here!
601,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Guys, I’ve got so much money. I’ll give you 25 coins not to--"
602,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," So, what?"
603,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Why are you even adventuring with us?
604,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," When people ask us why the brave adventurers ran away from the goblin house, we tell them we saw two scarecrows? Are you a crow, man?"
605,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, They were hanging! They were hanging from an arch!
606,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," They had cherry blood on them, Lucien told me. Tanzier, that’s your name, right?"
607,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Tanzer.
608,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Tanzer.
609,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Of the Silverviews. Because we can see silver.
610,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I know you’re--yes. Tell you what. Why don’t we keep--why don’t we try to rush to the house?
611,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Just make a break for it?
612,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I agree with Jeremy.
613,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Uh, Scales, please."
614,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I don’t understand your puns.
615,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I--scales for music--
616,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, It’s not even a pun.
617,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, --and scales like dragon scales.
618,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Still doesn’t make--
619,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, It’s perfect!
620,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I don’t understand. It doesn’t--it’s not sinking in.
621,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Just pretend it’s a nonsense word that you just call me by. Scales.
622,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Mmm, but your given name is Jeremy."
623,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Aww, g--all right, let’s run to the house. We’ll talk about this later."
624,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Okay.
625,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Let’s run--let’s run up there, Archie leading the way to get us to open the door."
626,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, [overlapping] I hate Jeremy. Okay.
627,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Archie should open the door.
628,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Yeah.
629,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you push him to the front?
630,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
631,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And he’s like,"
632,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie," Uhhh, tryin’ to--"
633,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, there’s no stealth anymore. We might as well just make a--"
634,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, As you guys are running--
635,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Just prodding him with your rapier.
636,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," As you guys are running up, you clearly haven’t attracting the attention of the patrolling goblin."
637,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, thank goodness."
638,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Or the ones digging. But as you’re running up, you’re about 30 feet away when the door bursts open, and three short figures dressed in goblin armor with, uh, like, with pale, greasy little faces come storming out."
639,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Seems like a bit much.
640,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be so mean to goblins."
641,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I’m disgusted.
642,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They come storming out and down the short steps from the doorway. Two of them are brandishing small crossbows, and one of them is carrying a rusted, uh, like a cleaver weapon, and they come running out, and they go,"
643,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Goblins," waawwakj;ksdljglkajsklghab,"
644,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," and they’re, like, shaking their weapons, and two of them are pointing their weapons at you."
645,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I understand Goblin, so I should know what they’re saying."
646,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
647,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Turns out they’re saying, “wasdfawjfw; lvhean;v”"
648,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The thing is, they’re speaking gibberish. They are definitely not speaking Goblin."
649,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Okay. Something seems amiss. I don’t think these are goblins, dudes."
650,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," They’re--they’re dressed up, right? They’re definitely--"
651,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," They’re wearing goblin armor. Does that--so Lucien, you’re saying that’s not Goblin they’re speaking?"
652,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, That’s not Goblin.
653,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yell something at them in Goblin. Say, like..."
654,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Give me--oh, yeah, yeah. I yell something at them in Goblin."
655,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Um, We mean you no harm."
656,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Don’t…
657,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Goblins?, wawdksj;lgkdjdskjgbk
658,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Okay, these are not goblins, dudes."
659,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Okay, let me say something. I’m Tanzer Silverview of the Silverviews."
660,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, That’s not helpful.
661,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, What language are you speaking?
662,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, Common."
663,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They… [laughs] Uh, they pause for a second."
664,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, [deliberately] The Silverviews?
665,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, One of them fires a crossbow bolt into the ground near you guys.
666,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, all right."
667,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Kicking up--kicking up dust. What do you want to do?
668,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. First, I’m gonna turn to Archie, and I’m gonna say,"
669,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," What is going on, Archie?"
670,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Why don’t we all--uh, it sounds like you guys are suspicious of what’s going on."
671,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I think so.
672,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," How about you all get to make--uh, not you, Lord Silverview. You two guys get to make investigation checks."
673,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
674,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Sure.
675,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Investigation--oh, and then--oh, good that’s a ski--proficiency of mine. But I didn’t roll too great. So I have--overall, I have a 14."
676,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you speak--you speak Goblin, Lucien. You get to roll an extra die ‘cause I’ll say you have advantage in this situation."
677,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I never get to roll extra die.
678,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Well, I got… [dice rolling] Jeez. Both of them are terrible."
679,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, How does speaking Goblin help him in a situation where they’re clearly not goblins?
680,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I got a 5 and a 4, so…"
681,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You, uh, they seem to be goblins to you! What’d you roll?"
682,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I--I--
683,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Nothing’s amiss!
684,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I have a 14.
685,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, you can tell, uh, you actually can tell that underneath that armor and all--and all the grease paint, that these goblins are actually halflings."
686,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Ohh! Hey, I speak Halfling!"
687,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They were not speaking Halfling. They were saying, “glasdkjgfadshkgk;adb.”"
688,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Well, no, but I can talk to them."
689,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You could, yeah, theoretically."
690,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah. Do I want to?
691,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah! Say something!
692,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s up to you.
693,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Like,"
694,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Hey, guys, I can see you’re not goblins. What’s going on?"
695,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, In Halfling.
696,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They stop their, uh, angry gesticulating...look at each other, and then you hear one of them say,"
697,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Halfling 1, Wait a minute. They speak Halfling. I think the ruse is up! 
698,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The other one says,"
699,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Halfling 2, Okay. I’ll go get Jacob. 
700,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And one guy goes running into the house.
701,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Okay. Uh, guys, they’re gonna go get Jacob."
702,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Archie’s--Archie says,"
703,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie, Wh--what are you--what are you guys doing? Kill those guys!
704,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," What--should we--I’m gonna be like,"
705,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Archie.
706,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, should we--"
707,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s hiding behind you.
708,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right, that’s fair. That’s fair."
709,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Archie, were you actually here when this attack happened, this supposed attack? Or did you just hear about it from your dad?"
710,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie," Uh, I was--I was here, it was just--with the fire and the screaming, I just--we ran out of there as fast as we could."
711,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Archie, was this--was the tapworks insured? Ahead of time?"
712,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Archie, are you stupid?"
713,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Look, we don’t have to ask him. We know the answer to that."
714,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Is this quest gonna end in insurance fraud?
715,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, That’s what I’m starting to think!
716,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, What an adventure!
717,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I’m starting to think I might not write a verse about this for our epic song, which begins [singing] here the story of travelers three...uh...wait, that’s not how the song goes. Let me--wait, let me--come up with something that rhymes with blue--"
718,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," While you’re arguing about your song, a--"
719,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Hold on-- [laughing]
720,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You guys see an--an older, more, let’s say more stately goblin halfling comes down the step wi--he has big, bushy, gray sideburns that are sticking out from underneath his, uh, his goblin helmet that has, uh, a--a pair of, like, ram’s horns on it to make it look more intimidating."
721,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Very impressive.
722,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And he comes down, and he’s followed by, uh, some--somebody that you assume is his brother, just--they share a passing resemblance. But he has dark, bushy, black eyebrows and is scowling at you guys, and he is carrying a, uh, a big club. Uh, well, the older one--"
723,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Dan, you take that guy if we have to--I mean Lucien."
724,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The older one, who is clearly this Jacob they talked about, he comes walking out, and he says--in Common, he says,"
725,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," It appears that our ruse has been, uhHH, seen through."
726,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He comes striding towards you guys.
727,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Yeah. Exactly. Yes. That is exactly what’s happened. So if you could explain the situation to us.
728,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, It appears that we’ve found ourselves at an impasse.
729,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Uh...
730,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, We have?
731,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," [laughing] How so? I mean, we came here...uh, well, you tell us, actually. What’s going on?"
732,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Archie, why don’t you explain what’s going on?"
733,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, the person least equipped to explain anything."
734,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Archie says,"
735,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie, I don’t know what’s going on!
736,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,"And, uh, the halfling says,",
737,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Halfling, They brought a Tapwell with them! They’re working for the Tapwells!
738,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We should’ve left Archie in the woods.
739,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," No, no! Let me be clear about one thing. Yes, we were hired by the Tapwells, but we want to know what’s going on, ‘cause, hey, y’know, y’know what? Maybe you guys are on the side of right on this one."
740,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, We were hired under false pretenses.
741,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Yeah.
742,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, They said that you were goblins who killed everybody. And I can see that these men are made of straw. The lowest form of men.
743,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Well, if they said we killed anybody, they are liars."
744,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, They killed a horse.
745,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," The only casualty was poor...uh, Buttercup, I believe her name was."
746,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Ohh, the most beautiful of all horse names!"
747,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I once had a horse, myself. Clops-a-Lot, I called him. I gave him away as a tip for-- [laughing] --at a restaurant once when I was drunk, and I’ll never forget it."
748,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," If I could take a moment to sing a madrigal about this, uh, about… [singing] ohh, let me tell you a song of Buttercup… [keeps singing]"
749,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There’s not a dry eye when you finish your madrigal, which is now. It’s finished. Everyone is--by the end of your song, everyone is arm in arm, swaying side to side, singing this song."
750,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, thank you, thank you! Scales Fangbattle, that’s the name to remember. Scales."
751,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Scales Fangbanger.
752,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, Fangbattle."
753,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Just joking, we don’t make fun of names here. This is a safe place."
754,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Thank you.
755,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So, uh--"
756,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Now that we’ve all become friends… [laughter] we would just ask that we allow--you allow us to enter the house, retrieve an object, and then we’ll be on our way, and you can run this Tapwell manor as--for all we care."
757,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Look, pretend to be goblins to your heart’s content."
758,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, There’s no judgment here.
759,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Of course, friend. It’s interesting that you mention that you’re looking for an object, for we are looking for the same thing. Come, let’s go eat and share some meat and mead."
760,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Umm…
761,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Sure!
762,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[theme music],
763,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Griffin," Hey everyone, it’s me, Griffin, your old pal and your old dungeon master. Look at you, cheatin’ on me with some other people’s adventures. Nah, that’s fine. We invited them into this house, and we hope that you have enjoyed it. I know I certainly have. I listened to it on a plane ride, uh, just front to back, and I got a lot of chuckles out of it. I think they did a great job, and I pray to God that they never open up their own Dungeons & Dragons podcast, or we are out of business. If you miss hearing my voice and the voices of the rest of my dumb family, uh, you can hear us on The Flop House this week. The episode’s gonna be up this Saturday. We were honored to be invited to take part in the most, uh, exalted of holidays, which is Shocktober, and, god, we watched the worst movie I’ve seen in a very long time, and, uh, I still have not recovered from the bad vibes that it gave me. So that’ll be up Saturday, and make sure you--you look it up! We’ll make sure to retweet it and do all that stuff."
764,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,"[ads, etc.]",
765,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[theme music],
766,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,{59,19}
767,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You guys go--
768,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughing],
769,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You’re bustled into the, uh--you’re bustled into the dining room."
770,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We keep getting bustled into meals.
771,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It’s much easier than waiting for you guys to do it. Like, wait for you guys to agree to it. So, uh, roughly a dozen of these halfling goblins kind of push you into the dining room. You can tell--as you pass through the various rooms of the mansion, you realize--"
772,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Can we just not call them halfling goblins? They’re halflings in goblin-face.
773,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, We’ll call them halflings.
774,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It’s offensive.
775,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The halflings push, uh, they--it’s clear that they actually  haven’t been, uh, they haven’t been destroying the house. The, uh, the kitchen is in ex--is in excessive use, I would say. There’s an older female halfling who is cookin’ up a storm, and it smells delicious."
776,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ohh! I’ll remember her for later.
777,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," As you’re walking toward the dining room, you do pass a study, uh, that has been ransacked. You can see papers lying around the floor, the desk has been overturned, and you can--you can only assume that more of this is going on upstairs. You can hear, uh, you can hear halflings rifling through cupboards. "
778,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, And don’t think--we haven’t forgotten about that hole they were digging.
779,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Always at the back of my mind is that hole. Every time we pass a window, I’m looking out to try to see the hole."
780,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Someday.
781,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Dan is just--has his face pressed up against the window.
782,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I see a hole I wanna get into.
783,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The--as, uh, as you--as you share guest rites and drink of the, uh, drink of the cider of the house and a delicious apple-based meal that is, I’m guessing, some kind of pork with apples? That’s good with apples, right?"
784,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," That sounds fine, yeah."
785,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, I’m assuming an apple cobbler."
786,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You know there’s a pie or a cobbler or some--
787,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," No, absolutely."
788,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Apple computers.
789,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep, that’s the only kind of computers that they do their books on. It’s very expensive, though. They’re expensive computers."
790,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, yeah."
791,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Um, so, uh, Jacob, Jacob Redcheek, as he introduces himself, tells you a sad story about how his great-grandfather, Zachariah Redcheek, once owned this land, and he was approached by a young, uh, a young up-and-coming cider merchant by the name of Tapwell, who offered to buy this farm. Unfortunately, well, yeah, unfortunately, Zachariah turned down that offer, and Tapwell returned a few days later with armed mercenaries who slew most of the family and burned his more to the ground."
792,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Horrifying.
793,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Tapw--uh, Redcheek and his brothers were, uh, bustled away?"
794,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughing],
795,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Hey! Bustling.
796,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Everybody’s bustling.
797,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The bustling town of Hogsbottom.
798,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," When we hear this, we all turn at Archie and stare at him very accusing."
799,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Right.
800,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He is enjoying his cobbler.
801,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Okay.
802,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, He really zones out.
803,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughter],
804,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He at first tried to go up to his bedroom. The halflings were not letting him do it. He tried to argue,"
805,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie, But all my stuff’s up there!
806,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, But night-night!
807,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, [unintelligible] I got school in the morning!
808,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie, Can I have some warm milk?
809,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Apple milk. Uh...so, uh, so Jacob Redcheek, his brother Darius, who you’re--who you realize is the older, grou--the other grouchy halfling with the black--"
810,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Black.
811,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," --bushy eyebrows, who scowls every time, uh, people say th--every time his brother tells a new, uh, new terrible thing about the Tapwells. Uh, you find out that this family has been traveling about, trying to, uh, trying to stay one step ahead from these Tapwell murderers, um, and living off the land until, uh, years and years later. Now, fully grown adults with children of their own, Jacob and Darius Redcheek came upon a little plan when they found a failed ambush with many dead goblins lying by the side of the road on the way to Phandalin."
812,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ahh.
813,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Clearly murdered by three very powerful adventurers.
814,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah. Some kind of adventurer...in a zone.
815,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Maybe. So they use this goblin armor that they found and a bunch of other goblin armor they found to set up a little, uh, like a little bit of play-acting, I guess, to try and scare the Tapwells off their land. And they’re hoping that if they, uh, search the manor house, they can find the original deed of ownership to the land that proves that the Redcheek halflings are the owners of this orchard."
816,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Guys, I think that’s in that box in the basement."
817,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Hmmm.
818,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, So what was it that you were looking for?
819,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Should we tell ‘em what we’re looking for, or…?"
820,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Why’s...I feel like we’re just giving away our only card, right? We should probably..."
821,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Well, hold on, how do we know that nobody got hurt in your raid on this house?"
822,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, y--Jacob Redcheek says,"
823,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Well, of course nobody was hurt! Did they tell you anybody who was actually killed?"
824,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I mean, they didn’t give us any names..."
825,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I sort of don’t remember.
826,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," In your search for knowledge, you’ve forgotten what happened the day before."
827,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, I wasn’t paying much attention.
828,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, The vision of Tarzen [sic] having sex with a barmaid has erased all your memories.
829,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," If any of you guys doubt him, you’re allowed to make a...insight check."
830,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [crosstalk] What was your name?
831,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, [crosstalk] Tanzer.
832,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [crosstalk] Tanzer.
833,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Insight check to see if he’s telling the truth.
834,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, [crosstalk] I do doubt him.
835,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, All right. I wanna do that too.
836,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I got, uh, proficiency in that."
837,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I don’t.
838,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
839,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I...I got a 16.
840,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I got a 9 plus 4, I got 13."
841,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, he doesn’t need to roll ‘cause he’s telling the truth, it appears."
842,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Ohh, like Daredevil, we listened to his heartbeat."
843,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, [laughing] Yeah. That’s what he does?
844,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, yeah."
845,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
846,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Hears the pulse.
847,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Well, you’ve already gotten 25 gold pieces each from…"
848,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Why don’t we call it a day, but we could help these people prove that it’s their land."
849,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Even better, we could charge them more gold pieces to give them the information about where the deed is."
850,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Eh, that’s not..."
851,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, A little bit of double dippin’.
852,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, I’m trying to help you guys out.
853,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, This seems not very heroic.
854,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," That’s how rich people get rich, is by swindling poor halflings."
855,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Yeah, this is a problem."
856,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, well…"
857,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Yeah, you guys don’t see angles in this whole thing."
858,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Mister...uh, what was your name? Garlic face?"
859,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, We’ll help you if we can get a look at that hole.
860,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Just let us dip our beaks in it, and that’s what we mean--and we pee in the hole."
861,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I have two questions. Two questions. What was your name again? Jacob...Redcheek?
862,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, My name is Jacob Redcheek.
863,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Redcheek. I should’ve remembered ‘cause your cheeks are so rosy.
864,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, Mhm.
865,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Two questions. One--
866,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And they’re getting rosier as he drinks more of this delicious Tapwell cider.
867,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Uh, if we were in a position to help you with some information--we’re not asking to sell it, that would not be heroic, but might there be, perhaps, some reward or show of your gratitude? And secondly, what’s in that hole outside."
868,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, the whole room gets quiet, and then Darius Redcheek turns to Jacob and says,"
869,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Darius, Of course! I knew they were mercenaries!
870,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Mercenaries is a harsh word. We’re adventurers! We never prom--we never...disguised ourselves as anything else, we said that the Tapwells hired us for a job, and we now think it was under  false pretenses. Look, sisters are doing it for themselves."
871,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Jacob Redcheek says,"
872,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Darius, let us hear them out. What do you...you say...do you know where the deed is?"
873,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, We...
874,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, No one said that.
875,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," We--no one said that, but we may have a clue."
876,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, Is that a legally binding thing you said?
877,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I’m not a lawyer, I wouldn’t know. I’m an artist. And as an artist, I like to play things as they go and not worry about the rules. Although, you th--the funny thing about the art is, you really need to know the rules of the piece very well before you can play around with them. Allow me to explain through the use of song. Now, if I’m just playing this song normally-- [hums McDonald’s jingle] --I’ve had to go--"
878,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," As, uh, uh, Scales starts playing--"
879,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Thank you.
880,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, --I’m gonna try and slowly sneak out and see if I can find an entrance to the basement.
881,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you’re trying to distract them.
882,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I’m not trying to, I’m just explaining how--"
883,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," What I was going to explain was how ragging a song, adding little, uh, extra skips and beats and things like that changes it, right?"
884,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I find him very distracting.
885,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," This is knowledge, you should be so happy about this! I’m dropping real knowledge on these fools! Not fools. Good guys."
886,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You--I’m gonna say that he’s helping you, so you get to do a--a...assisted, uh, you get advantage on this stealth roll."
887,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Okay.
888,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Can I have another one of these?
889,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep, you ma--Tanzer gets to roll stealth."
890,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
891,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, 6, 7, 2?"
892,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oooh, not amazing."
893,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You knock a pie pan over.
894,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, These are loaded dice.
895,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," A container of apple juice just, like--"
896,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You bump into the old woman who’s cooking and knock her into a stove.
897,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Into the fire.
898,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Woman, Ahhh! My biscuits are burning!
899,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, so, of course everybody stops. Uh, record scratch."
900,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I was talking!
901,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, Going somewhere?
902,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Uh, n-nooo, I--I--I--wh--where’s your bathroom? Where’s the restroom?"
903,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Oh, uh...Zach, take him over to the bathroom."
904,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So one of the halflings hops up and takes you by the hand. [laughter] It’s kind of like a weird child man is taking you into the bathroom. Like, normally, the roles are reversed, but it’s cool."
905,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I’m protesting along the way, like, I can go myself. I don’t need this. I’m fine."
906,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Look, Jeremy, while that idiot’s out of--"
907,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Scales!
908,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Well--Jeremy.
909,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Scales.
910,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, While that idiot’s out of here--I did a perception check. It seems like he’s telling the truth. I feel like we should just help them find this...document.
911,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Okay. UhHHH, I mean, there--some things are more important than money. That’s true. I was trying to help us out, but you’re right. You’re right, I think."
912,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," We do have a meager amount of mo--no, Darius, we can offer this. [with Tapwell’s voice] We do have a meager amount of money that--"
913,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," This is the wrong guy. Different person. All of a sudden, Ambrose Tapwell appeared."
914,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," I could offer a small amount of money for information, but I...I couldn’t give it to you until, of course, we have the deed in hand."
915,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I feel weird making decisions like this without Silverview, even though he’s a moron."
916,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, Silverview, we split up the party. That’s always a bad idea in D&D ‘cause you might not be able to take on the thing that you have to battle. I’m guessing something in the toilet. What are you doing?"
917,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I’m in the--I’m in the bathroom with the--I assume the guy outside.
918,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, it’s like a chamber. Uh, one of those, you know, like a bathroom."
919,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Do I have my own room, or am I in the stall and he’s outside the stall?"
920,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, you have your own room."
921,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Okay, I’m looking around, trying to see if there’s a secret entrance to the basement from the bathroom."
922,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You’re just sticking your hand in the toilet?
923,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, I’m sticking my hand in the toilet, I’m, like, waving it under the sink, I’m doing--I’m, like, unscrewing the pipes."
924,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There’s no sink, there’s a basin of water and a hole that you shit in."
925,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Keep in mind, you have nothing at all to lead you on to believe there’s a secret entrance to the basement in the bathroom."
926,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," No, no, but at this point--it’s the only option now. Is there a window?"
927,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," In your family manor, I’m assuming, in Silverview manor, there’s a secret entrance."
928,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Every room has a secret passage to the basement in Silverview manor. Is there a window in the bathroom?
929,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, there’s a small window to allow smells to escape."
930,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Can I go through the window?
931,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, it is, uh, too small, and there’s bars to prevent a bird from landing on your head while you’re using the bathroom."
932,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That’s a good thing to have.
933,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I, um…"
934,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sounds like this, uh, line of, uh, stealth is comin’ up with nothing. They have confounded your attempts."
935,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The adventure of the barred bathroom.--
936,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Very much mission impossible.
937,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, --may have to come to a close.
938,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I walk back into the kitchen with--my arm all the way up to my elbow is, like, soaked in toilet water."
939,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There’s no water, it’s just a hole!"
940,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And ironically, now you have to use the bathroom. You spent so long in there."
941,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I’m trying to hold it in now, yeah."
942,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," ‘Cause it’d be weird. You don’t want people to think that you have, like, a bladder infection that you picked up from some woman in Hogsbottom."
943,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so…"
944,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Silverview--
945,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Back to the negotiation table.
946,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Seems like these guys are telling the truth. Uh, Buttwatcher has suggested that we just help out the Redcheeks."
947,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Without any money, without any advantage on our--?"
948,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," They said they have a little bit they can possibly give us, but there are more important things than money. Look, wouldn’t you rather inspire people with your noble deeds? As described in song!"
949,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I’m--you g--I need my own wealth. I need to become my own man. So I need a cash reserve that I can--like, that can allow me to not just live off the--sponging off my father’s who found his money by seeing silver."
950,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Lord Silvervew, "
951,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," he says as he touches Silverview’s hand and then immediately draws back ‘cause his hand is covered in whatever,"
952,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, You can--there’s more than one way to become a man. Wealth isn’t everything. Perhaps respect? Is what you’re looking for?
953,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," All right, you know what, fine. I will--but I want the majority of money we take. From them. "
954,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, As long as you promise not to give it away as a tip!
955,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Since I only value knowledge, I’m fine with that."
956,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Fine. Good.
957,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, I would prefer that this--people in the future look at me as having done this just for the good of things. Maybe that’ll help me get some ladies so I can make children for my--
958,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Oh, don’t act all noble."
959,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, That’ll be another great verse in this epic tale.
960,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, yes."
961,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Then it’s settled. So we’re splitting it 60-20-20.
962,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Sure.
963,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Good. Then yes! Yes, sir, uh, uh, Sir Jacob? We have--"
964,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Sir?
965,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," We have some information--well, I assume you’re a noble man. I see here you have a manor house."
966,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, You’re dressed in goblin stuff.
967,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Uh, well,"
968,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," he says,"
969,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, so...what information do you have?
970,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," We may know the location of a chest that could possibly have the deed in it. I believe you didn’t answer the second question, which was what’s with that hole?"
971,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Oh, that hole. No, see, after Tapwell murdered my great-grandfather and a few of our kin, they simply tossed the bodies in a mass grave, and we’re trying to unbury them, uncover the bones so we can rebury them."
972,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," That’s so much less fun than I was hoping it would be. Hoping it would be, like, gold or a dragon’s egg or something."
973,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, That’s the worst hole I’ve ever heard of.
974,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," All right, let’s go get the deed then, fine, fine."
975,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, and I apologize for--"
976,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, and, uh, and it still seems like he’s telling the truth? Should we do a perception check on that?"
977,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, let’s do a perception check on that."
978,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Insensitive.
979,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[crosstalk],
980,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I don’t wanna be a mass grave denier on this. I feel like maybe we should--
981,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Go up and stare him in the eyes. Check his pulse.
982,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I don’t think he’d make that up.
983,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, All right.
984,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Too depressing a lie.
985,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Let’s go...uh, look. To quote a m--some musical heroes of Scales Fangbattle, the Ramones, I don’t wanna go to the basement. Down in the basement. But let’s go."
986,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Man, he has a rich fantasy world."
987,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, It’s wonderful.
988,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah. It’s a whole--
989,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," These Ramones, I guess?"
990,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," They’re not really brothers, but they dress like they are!"
991,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, ‘Cause all brothers dress alike.
992,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Look at the fuckin’ Tapwells! Pardon my language! The Redcheeks, they’re dressed exactly the same except with different horn helmets!"
993,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, So I assume that we’re now bustled down to the basement.
994,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You are bustled down into the cellar. Now, the cellar is--is a labyrinth of, uh, foodstuffs and, uh, wine racks and cider casks, uh, and you--to the northeast corner--"
995,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I grab one for a little refreshment as we--
996,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, what, the cider?"
997,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah.
998,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Or a food sack.
999,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, A little cider.
1000,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I mean, we’ve just been drinking and eating apple products."
1001,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," No, it’s fine, but I…"
1002,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They don’t keep a lot of apple products down here. They don’t need to. Like, a giant wheel of cheese? Imagine Bilbo Baggins, like--it’s basically like that."
1003,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, With dwarves singing songs and throwing crockery around.
1004,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, ‘cause there’s no songs being sung right now."
1005,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Reminds me of a song!
1006,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So you guys make it to the northeast corner. Clearly it’s a dirt floor cellar, and there’s a--underneath a--uh, there’s a barrel sitting there, a barrel that is easily pushed aside."
1007,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, who wants to do the honors of pushing that barrel aside?"
1008,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I’ll push this barrel aside. I do have a question. Why didn’t they--they’ve been ransacking the whole house, they haven’t touched this part of the house?"
1009,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It’s weird that they didn’t go to the basement.
1010,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, they’ve clearly been down here ‘cause they’ve been--"
1011,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Eating the food.
1012,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Ransacking all the food, but they haven’t gotten--they haven’t started just digging up the floor in the cellar."
1013,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I guess that’s a pretty extreme--when you’re looking for a piece of paper, that’s a pretty extreme way to go."
1014,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Archie is not happy, but he doesn’t really have much say in it, and he is currently being guarded by the halflings."
1015,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," Here, Archie, nibble on this cheese."
1016,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, He would probably like that a lot.
1017,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He likes cheese, but it doesn’t sit well with him, so they might have to guard him in the bathroom for a while later."
1018,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I push the barrel aside and start, uh, digging to the chest."
1019,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, With your hands? Or do you ask for a shovel?
1020,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Do you whip it aside like a real hero?
1021,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Do you make somebody else dig? What do you--
1022,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, I push the barrel as--is there a shovel around?"
1023,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, you can fetch one."
1024,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," It’s usually--right now, it’s in mass grave removal duty, but we can take one."
1025,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Yeah, we need to take some time off from searching for the bones of your murdered ancestors to find this, uh..."
1026,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, after a few tense moments, a halfling gives you a shovel."
1027,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Great.
1028,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It’s a small shovel, so you have to stoop down, and you look a little silly, but there’s no babes around."
1029,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, All right.
1030,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, there’s a young halfling woman, but...well, that--"
1031,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Well! Does that change what you wanna do?
1032,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, She’s covered in grease paint and goblin--she smells like she’s wearing goblin armor.
1033,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," He’s into roleplaying, so it kind of turns him on even more."
1034,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," All right, I grab the shovel from him and start digging."
1035,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, man, what hidden knowledge awaits you? Well, you learn that digging is not a lot of fun. Uh, after you dig--you dig for--it takes maybe about 15, 20 minutes of digging before you--your shovel strikes wood as you find a...oak, iron-bound, uh, treasure chest."
1036,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ooooh!
1037,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, With a lock on it.
1038,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Oh…
1039,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Hmmmm…
1040,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Is there any way that we can try and pick that lock?
1041,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, UhhHH…
1042,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Can we whip the lock?
1043,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Smash it open? Is it--how strong is it?
1044,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," We...I’m going to assume--we could make dice rolls, but I’m going to assume that, given enough energy and effort, and you’re not trying to be secretive, you’re able to crack that lock off that--off that chest. And creeeaaak. The chest opens, and there’s a demon in there, and you all die."
1045,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[all yell],
1046,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Just joking.
1047,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," What’s that Archie doing? What’s amazing is when you said, “de,” I thought you meant “deed.”"
1048,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So it’s actually--it’s a small chest, it’s filled with a number of personal effects, there’s a lock of hair that is now straw-thin. There’s a locket with a silhouette in it, a cameo. And then there’s--"
1049,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Archie’s prom photos?
1050,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, there’s a couple signet rings, you--there’s, uh, uh, some kind of a wedding ring that you’re assuming was Ar--Archie’s mom’s wedding ring."
1051,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," So we may have--we may have just found, like, a box of keepsakes from, uh, Mr. Tapwell’s life."
1052,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You also find multiple scroll cases.
1053,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Oh.
1054,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That after searching through, you find, uh, you--you--you are able to find the deed, uh, that is made out to, uh, the z--uh, Zevulon Redcheek of the Redcheek halflings, made out by the local baron, uh, uhh, Baron von Bogenhofen. "
1055,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Mmm, yes, family friend."
1056,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Do you have knowledge--yeah, he is a family friend, actually. Do "
1057,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,you have knowledge arcana?,
1058,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Knowledge arcana. No…
1059,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Under knowledge? Do you--or intelligence.
1060,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Under intelligence.
1061,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Do you have arcana?
1062,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, No.
1063,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, but you can make an intelligence check anyway. Roll it, Dan. I mean Lucien."
1064,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, A 12.
1065,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, you can, uh, you can detect that there’s a--you can tell there’s something magical about this, uh, some kind of minor enchantment just to prove that it’s, like, legal."
1066,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That legal magic.
1067,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[crosstalk],
1068,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
1069,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, all magic stuff’s legal to--seems magic to the uninitiated."
1070,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," That’s true, yeah. Arthur C. Clarke said that."
1071,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you have a deed."
1072,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1073,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The halflings are celebrating! Cracking open bottles!
1074,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Now, guys..."
1075,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," I guess that’s another successful adventure, guys."
1076,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Hooray, we’ve done it."
1077,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," We did it, we did it!"
1078,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Now, about the fee..."
1079,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Uh, fee is the wrong word. Uh, there was talk of s--a gratuity?"
1080,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Uh…
1081,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," That actually sounds--yeah, it’s just, like, a little token? A little--"
1082,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Now, about our ransomed man?"
1083,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, no, no. Now, do--are we holding the deed? Or are they holding the deed?"
1084,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s holding the deed.
1085,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. Wait, who is? Lucien?"
1086,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Lucien, yeah."
1087,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1088,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So Jacob says,"
1089,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," So, about the fee...I...we--I mentioned money, or we could offer perhaps a value much more than that in the form of goods. Could take the barge? You could take as much of this cider as you can carry? Its value far exceeds what I’d be wil--what kind of coinage we can pay, but unfortunately...just having the deed is not enough, heroes."
1090,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I think we gotta talk to the baron, probably, right?"
1091,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob," Because, unless he is brought to justice, Tapwell will keep sending tough adventuring dudes like you guys--"
1092,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Thank you!
1093,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Jacob, --to try and wrest the manor from--the land from us.
1094,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Uh, so how would we go about stopping Tapwell?"
1095,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, What’s your solution here? Kill Tapwell?
1096,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Archie goes,"
1097,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Archie," Ooh, that’s my dad!"
1098,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And then he realizes. I’d be the Tapwell now, dogs!"
1099,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," He just said brought to justice, he didn’t say we had to murder him."
1100,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Well, is there a court system here? This is an anus-fueled economy town, I don’t understand where the--what the system of justice is here."
1101,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, this is Deadwood, basically."
1102,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, you d--there are options. You could either--you could go to the local sheriff--"
1103,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. Oh, that burly dwarf that we saw!"
1104,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Or you could go all the way--you could make the longer trip down to Wolfsburg to seek an audience with Baron Emil von Bogenhofen.
1105,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Well, I know what sounds more fun to me."
1106,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," He’s also a family friend, so he’ll just do--he’ll--surely he’ll do what I ask. Our families are--go back a long way."
1107,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Can we get to Wolfhaven or whatever on the barge?
1108,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you can take--it’s downriver."
1109,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, is there--I don’t want Tapwell to get away, like, if he catches wind of what’s going on. Clearly, Archie has to stay here, but he doesn’t care, he’s eatin’ cheese and apples like nobody’s business."
1110,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," He’ll be spending his days in the cellar eating and his nights on the toilet, so I think he’ll be taken care of for a while."
1111,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, I think, let’s take the barge down to, what was it called, to Wolfhaven?"
1112,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Wolfsburg.
1113,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Wolfsburg. Oh, yeah, like, it’s where they’re all wolves."
1114,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Like in DuckTales.
1115,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s uh- It’s- It’s Wolf Mountain.
1116,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1117,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," It’s like Duckburg, there’s a bunch of anthropomorphic wolves that live there, I assume."
1118,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep, that’s gonna be super fun!"
1119,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, It’s a wolf blur.
1120,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Uhh…
1121,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, we have the deed, though, right?"
1122,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We’re gonna have to take it with us.
1123,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yes.
1124,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, We have to take it with us.
1125,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And you also will have to take one of the Redcheek halflings with you.
1126,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Gah, it’s always some…"
1127,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," To verify. You can’t--it’s not like you can take the deed and be like, “See? This guy told us.”"
1128,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, can we take the daughter with us? Or...should we take…"
1129,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Oh, no."
1130,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, There’s only one--they only brought one daughter with them. You could take one of the young boys.
1131,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Eh…
1132,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Can we take the one who’s not dumb? Is there one--can we get a smart one?
1133,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yes, of course there’s ones that are not dumb."
1134,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, it’s only the Tapwells are dumb."
1135,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Archie was the--we messed up with Archie. We got the dumb kid.
1136,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I assumed both of them were dumb.
1137,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," That’s true, that’s probably true."
1138,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Maybe the other Tapwell twin was brilliant. Maybe he got all the smarts in the womb of Mrs. Tapwell.
1139,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It just seems like Tapwell is--well, no, he actually--he based his decision on an eating contest, so he didn’t really care which of his sons went, now that I think about it, so…"
1140,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Let’s take the whole trunk with us because, as much as I believe Tapwell should be brought to justice, my artist’s heart is touched by his devotion to his fair departed wife, and I would hate to see these artifacts, as unjust as his treatment of your ancestors’ bones has been, I would hate to see them tossed to the winds or defiled in some way."
1141,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," And I think we could probably sell them in a pawn shop for some sweet cash, so let’s...let’s take them."
1142,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Let’s take the whole trunk.
1143,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sweet cash. You can give that cameo to a woman that you just met.
1144,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Hell yeah! Thanks for the silhouette of somebody else?
1145,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Do you--I mean, do you--they’re not that discerning about silhouettes."
1146,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I guess so. So, yeah, let’s take one of the, uh, one of the Redcheek boys."
1147,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, let’s say you take, uh, Me--no, Pasha Redcheek."
1148,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Pasha?
1149,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Pasha Redcheek?
1150,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1151,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, All right.
1152,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s short for Alexander.
1153,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," But he doesn’t have to--oh, he’s Russian, I see."
1154,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sure.
1155,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," But he doesn’t have to be dressed up like a fake goblin anymore, right?"
1156,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, of course not. He puts on the finery befitting a halfling commoner."
1157,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," [laughing] Okay. So let’s get on that boat, boys!"
1158,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He also brings his, uh, his grandfather’s...signet ring of the Redcheek family."
1159,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It has a--it has a--
1160,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, To prove that he’s a Redcheek halfling.
1161,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Small symbol of it, the Redcheeks."
1162,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It also helps that he has very red cheeks.
1163,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now, how--"
1164,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I need a signet ring.
1165,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," What time is it? Should we just make haste and go overnight in the barge, ‘cause it’s nighttime, right? Or should we--"
1166,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You should probably rest overnight, otherwise--"
1167,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay. We’ve used none of our spells. Uh.
1168,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, And none of our hit points.
1169,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Let’s rest, though. Yeah."
1170,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I wanna go to the, uh, halfling daughter and, uh, chat her up."
1171,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, This does not go well.
1172,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, 5.
1173,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What do you say to her?
1174,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Uh, I don’t know if you heard back there, but I’m Tanzer Silverview? So here’s the...key to--to Archie’s room where I’ll be staying."
1175,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Halfway through, I realize that my hotel key--it doesn’t--doesn’t apply here, so I just kind of mumble out that, uh,"
1176,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Archie’s [clears throat] key to his--or the hole, if you want, you know, like, uh, there…"
1177,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Have sex with you in the grave of her ancestors.
1178,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, She slaps you.
1179,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right, that’s fair."
1180,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Now it’s Scales’s turn to shine, like scales in the sun. I say,"
1181,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Watch this, Tanzer."
1182,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, and I make a play."
1183,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1184,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, And I--
1185,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Roll your die.
1186,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. Can I say what my--my, uh, my line is?"
1187,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yeah.
1188,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I invite her to come with me to the woods and hear some songs in the moonlight.
1189,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, wow, that’s pretty good."
1190,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
1191,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1192,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, 14 plus my charisma?
1193,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep.
1194,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, 17.
1195,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, she’s up for it. She comes with you and listens to songs in the moonlight, but she’s saving herself for marriage."
1196,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Ohh, no, I wasted my songs!"
1197,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Even when you win, you lose, Scales!"
1198,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," How far do I get? To, like, second base? What’s the--"
1199,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, no, you get to f--wait, what’s second base?"
1200,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I don’t know in this fantasy world.
1201,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, [unintelligible]
1202,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Let’s say, let’s say it’s, uh, she gives him a handy."
1203,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, that’s not--"
1204,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That too much?
1205,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, yeah, no, she’s up for that. She’s a halfling."
1206,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah.
1207,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Out in the woods? Or in the room we’re all sleeping in?
1208,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, In the woods!
1209,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, In the woods.
1210,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Come on.
1211,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, His little...dragon...love nestle that he has.
1212,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Why is it smaller for a dragon?
1213,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Okay, let’s bustle ourselves to sleep."
1214,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay!
1215,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, I’m sleepin’ well tonight."
1216,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Crack of dawn, the cock crows and wakes you all. You travel by barge down the stream."
1217,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And I go,"
1218,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Don’t tell your dad about this.
1219,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, until you reach, uh, reach where the stream connects with the wandering river, and continue going south. Past Hogsbottom and its dirty tannery, awful-filled waters. You skirt the edges of the town, continue south until you reach the...by...uhh, I would say by midday, you reach the, uh, the--the port at the bottom of Wolfsburg, the Wolf’s Mountain, seat and fastness of the Bogenhofen family, the baron of the local area. Uh, after parking and stowing your boat, uh, you make your way up to the fortress itself, which is, uh, basically a small town. Basic--uh, just--to m--to make matters, uh, fast, so we don’t, uh, seduce everybody in this town, we, uh, you request an audience with the baron. Um, and after waiting an interminably long time--"
1220,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, What?
1221,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Uh…
1222,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Our families know each other!
1223,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, actually, yeah, you--y--you were able to grease the wheels a little bit with your name. You are pushed to the front of the queue, all on the Silverview name."
1224,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yessss.
1225,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Um, and, uh, after, uh, you--the--the three of you are announced as “Lord Silverview, two adventurers, and...Alexander Redcheek, representing the Redcheek halflings’ claim on the Tapwell orchard.” And he, uh, reads out--he--he offers for you to make your case as to what is going on. The baron is sitting there next to the steward who made the announcement. The baron is an older man who is--has to lean forward to hear you guys speak, and occasionally whispers to his steward, uh, things."
1226,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Uh, uh, wh--elf, you wanna...you wanna get the--you sound trustworthy, you wanna give the--"
1227,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Alexander is way too nervous to speak to the baron.
1228,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah. Yeah, “Alexander, do you wanna--” “gahsglkhagkhades; dkhf” “Okay then.”"
1229,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He drank too much on the ride down with you guys. Uh, yeah."
1230,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I’m the family friend, but all right, let the elf go."
1231,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Yeah, Silverview--"
1232,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I summarize what, uh, what happened, but it’s--I do it North by Northwest style where we just walk across some propellers and no one hears it, so…"
1233,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," The characters hear it, but the audience doesn’t."
1234,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, So as not to bore the audience by recapping everything that we’ve just done.
1235,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, All the great things that happened in the adventure so far?
1236,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Okay.
1237,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So you’re listening to The Adventure Zone, guys."
1238,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I got a handjob, do we tell him about that?"
1239,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Sure.
1240,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Probably not. Not in front of her brother.
1241,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You would come to blows at that point. Uh, so, um, af--th-the room is quiet after your tale, Lucien. And the baron leans over and whispers something to his steward, who says,"
1242,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Steward," Your tale has moved the Baron Emil von Bogenhofen. And he offers to--he sees your claim to the land and offers to help you bring Ambrose Tapwell, the laggard, to justice."
1243,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," So in real terms, that means...uh...fighters to go with us?"
1244,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Steward, We will send a detachment of soldiers with you to bring him back here to Wolfsburg to face retribution.
1245,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Sounds harsh.
1246,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Sounds good.
1247,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Right, is this a dead or alive thing here that we can…? Can we bring him back?"
1248,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Let’s try to bring him back alive.
1249,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," I’m just saying, like, do we have to?"
1250,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Steward, If possible.
1251,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, All right.
1252,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, and I am overjoyed at the baron’s, uh, mercy, and I--"
1253,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Alexander turns to you and he goes,"
1254,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Alexander," We did it, guys! We did it!"
1255,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," We’re not out of the woods yet, but we are far enough through the woods to sing a song."
1256,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, His face falls when you start to talk to him.
1257,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, [singing] Baron--
1258,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, ‘Cause he remembers seeing his sister walk into the woods with you.
1259,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, We were just talking about how much she loves her family!
1260,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Hmmm.
1261,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," You seemed so relaxed when you guys were leaving, though, I don’t understand."
1262,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Almost sleepy!
1263,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I completely blow his cover.
1264,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Uh.
1265,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," You really rushed to the woods, but then when you walked back, you were really takin’ your time."
1266,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Sauntering, almost. A satisfied saunter."
1267,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," You kept goin’, “You hear me, Silverview!?”"
1268,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," To org-- [laughs] Uh, to organize these soldiers and set forth, you have to spend the night in Wolfsburg in a haunted mansion!"
1269,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Whaaaat.
1270,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," That’s great, though."
1271,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You have to spend the night in the local tavern.
1272,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Sounds great.
1273,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, A haunted tavern?
1274,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s not a haunted tavern.
1275,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Aww.
1276,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Unless it’s haunted by the cries of joy from all your friends.
1277,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeeaah!
1278,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, you wake up at the crack of dawn the next day."
1279,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We wake up so early.
1280,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You are bustled out of bed.
1281,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Let me get dressed!
1282,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Ow- Oh- Ow! You’re hurting me.
1283,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, A detachment of soldiers led by a stern female sergeant--
1284,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Hello! Looks like the Silverview-Fangbattle feud is at it again! A rivalry, let’s say."
1285,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I have, of course, evolved past such--"
1286,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Thanks, Buttwatcher."
1287,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, --base desires.
1288,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, What’s her name?
1289,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Her name is Ursa von Gearsburgen.
1290,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Wow, that sounds tough."
1291,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And she does not like adventurers.
1292,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, just as we walk, I make sure I walk alongside her to let her know that I’m a nobleman like her."
1293,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Ursa von Gearsburgen, Noblemen. What has a nobleman ever done that’s noble?
1294,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, She scoffs at you.
1295,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I set my horse back two paces.
1296,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You also don’t have a horse.
1297,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I remember Clopper--Clops-a-Lot for a minute. I--I--I walk back for a couple of steps and just give a very long wink to Scales.
1298,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Mmmm!
1299,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You guys are the--the four of you guys are riding in the back of a cart?
1300,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[laughter],
1301,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We just kinda--
1302,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I scoot back in the cart.
1303,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," During all this, I’m just sitting in the corner meditating."
1304,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The soldiers are marching behind the cart, and she’s riding on a horse next to you. Uh, actually."
1305,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So she’s lookin’ pretty cool!
1306,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, Zander is driving the cart that’s being pulled by an oxen."
1307,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1308,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so--"
1309,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Zander.
1310,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Alexander Redcheek.
1311,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The son.
1312,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Pasha, sorry."
1313,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s got a lot of nicknames.
1314,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, he’s Russian, come on."
1315,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So they--you travel over land, over mountain, through hill and stream. Uh, ‘til mid--uh, roughly midday when you cross, uh, you crest a ridge and see laid out before you the town of Hogsbottom."
1316,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Did we just leave our boat at Wolfsburg?
1317,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you can get it later."
1318,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1319,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, It’s a barge.
1320,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I mean, yeah, you paid for it. You paid for a week in the marina."
1321,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I mean, the thing is, it’s just a money suck. ‘Cause we have to pay for it being housed at the marina."
1322,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[crosstalk],
1323,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, It’s the biggest mistake we’ve ever made.
1324,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," We got insurance payments on it, yeah."
1325,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," It just looks amazing, though."
1326,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you really just wanna tell people, “Do you wanna go out on the boat for the weekend?”"
1327,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah.
1328,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," We painted a thing on the side that said, “The Phandalin Flyer.” In memory of Phandalin."
1329,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I was gonna call it the Songwater, but…"
1330,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Each side has some name on it.
1331,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, each side has--warring names."
1332,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So as you crest a ridge, you see Hogsbottom laid out before you. Uh, the town is, uh, maybe about half a mi--a half a mile down the hill."
1333,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Great.
1334,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Um, and--"
1335,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Almost there.
1336,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," However, you see the town is in turmoil."
1337,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Uh-oh.
1338,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Stre--uh, streams of smoke rise from the town, and you can see a--it looks like the town is being attacked by a small army of goblins!"
1339,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Noooo!
1340,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Whaaaat.
1341,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No doubt led by infamous local warlord, Klaarg."
1342,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Wait, are these real goblins?"
1343,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They appear to be real goblins this time, and seeing them--you’re not up close, but seeing them, you can--you’re super irritated with yourself that you ever confused them in the first place."
1344,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, They don’t even look alike at all.
1345,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Now, streaming away from the town, uh, over, uh, across the river, you can see whatever people, uh, whatever refugees have managed to gather their things are trying to run away from these goblins and are fording the river in various places to do so. The town guard is fighting a battle against the goblins, but it is still close. Now, also, cl--a little bit closer to you at a part of the river that is a little bit more easily forded, you see a, uh, you see a covered wagon laden with goods and, uh, personal effects, and sitted--seated on this wagon is one Ambrose Tapwell and his son Augustus."
1346,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ahh.
1347,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And kind of trying to drive the oxen pulling this cart forward, you see a short, dour dwarf character who clearly seems to be in cahoots with Tapwell, as he is running away from his town in its time of need!"
1348,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, this is when the sheriff is needed most."
1349,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh. Clearly...it’s time for some adventurers. The sergeant says,"
1350,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Ursa von Gearsburgen, The soldiers and I can take care of the goblins. You stop Tapwell.
1351,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Oh, that’s much easier, yeah, let’s do it!"
1352,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien," That’s what I was gonna suggest anyway, so..."
1353,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, That’s a great idea.
1354,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Scales is a little relieved and also a little irritated that he gets to m--that there’s not a--
1355,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," The song is worse if it’s, they’re up-- [singing] the goblins attacked the town that day, but we went off the other way to stop a man named Tapwell…"
1356,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, You don’t have to mention what could’ve happened in the song. You can just mention the stuff we did.
1357,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," I’m just following my muse, dude."
1358,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right, so let’s--so we--"
1359,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The soldiers go marching away quickly.
1360,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," But once we stop Tapwell, we can go fight some goblins, maybe?"
1361,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sure, maybe. We’ll see if we have enough time."
1362,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1363,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, yeah, we’ll see if the listeners want to keep listening to us fight goblins."
1364,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [laughing] Probably not.
1365,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Is Tapwell in the middle of the river? Is he mid-ford?
1366,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," They are, yeah, they’re crossing it. It looks like the easiest--you can either try and pull the cart up to the river and you can try and swim after him, or you can cross a, uh, you can cross a bridge a little bit further up and, uh, and cut him off on the land where he’s trying to land."
1367,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, should we surround him with--with one on one side and two on the other?"
1368,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, No.
1369,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right, well then let’s, uh…"
1370,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," ‘Cause, what, is he gonna turn around--he’s gonna turn around and go back to goblin town? Come on."
1371,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Well, if he doesn’t hit the other shore! All right, sure, yeah, let’s go--"
1372,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It feels like if we divide ourselves into parts--
1373,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I don’t want to get in a situation where we’re all on one side of the river and then he goes the other way so we have to run all the way back around to the other side of the river, he goes away, and just kinda run back and forth."
1374,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And, what, he’s just fording the river back and forth?"
1375,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, like we’ll get tired first!"
1376,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That’s not how rivers work.
1377,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Have you ever played Oregon Trail? It’s very hard to ford rivers.
1378,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, He’s not gonna just turn around and do it again.
1379,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," No, I haven’t played Oregon Trail!"
1380,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He used to have five sons; three of them have already died in this river.
1381,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, god."
1382,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," He’s got so few--oh, he’s got so few sons."
1383,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Now I feel bad for him.
1384,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s the great tragedy at this point.
1385,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Let’s just--we’ll--let’s go around the bridge and approach him.
1386,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Let’s go around the bridge and cut him off the path.
1387,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, We’ll cut him off the path. We’ll stand on the shoreline as he’s trying to get to it.
1388,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Alexander Redcheek takes his orders, nods to you, and snaps the reins on the oxen, which plods its way down the hill!"
1389,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Is there any way we can make this ox go a little faster?
1390,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It crosses the, uh, it crosses the bridge. All the while, you can see Tapwell and, uh, Bartok Rocksplitter trying to urge their, uh, cart up onto the shore."
1391,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [laughing] Bartok.
1392,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, you’re able--uh, you’re--Zander pulls on--Alexander Redcheek, of course--pulls on the reins to bring the cart to a halt on the, uh, the gravel trail that is, uh, is right opposite the bank that has the, uh, has the enemy cart slowly being pushed up onto the--onto the shore. Uh, Bartok Rocksplitter is coming around with water lapping at his boots, and you can see that, uh, there’s m--uh, uh, a second--a second guard in, uh, Tapwell--in a Tapwell doublet comes climbing out as well. So it’s Tapwell’s son, Tapwell, some guard, and Bartok Rocksplitter."
1393,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Mhm.
1394,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I shout to him.
1395,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You have just enough time to get set up and make something cool--decide what cool thing you’re gonna say to them.
1396,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Oh. Uhh…
1397,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So are you guys gonna stay in the car, or are you gonna climb down off the cart?"
1398,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Let’s get out of this cart!
1399,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Let’s get out of the cart, sure."
1400,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Come on! Let’s get outta the cart and go meet him on the shore. How many of us have distance weapons? I have a shortbow.
1401,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I have a whip.
1402,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I also have a shortbow.
1403,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I have a long bow too.
1404,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Let’s get out of the cart, but it’s not like we need to run up to him and go face-to-face. Y’know, we’ll--we wanna get outta the cart so we can fight this dude."
1405,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," We should tell him that we have a verbal warrant for his arrest, though."
1406,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good idea."
1407,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
1408,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Why don’t you say it? So he’ll be like, “Oh, the law, then I better stop.”"
1409,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Halt, Tapwell! It’s me, Tanzer Silverview, of the Silverviews! We have a verbal warrant for your arrest!"
1410,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, What are you talking about? Did you find my documents?
1411,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Oh, we found quite a bit. We found that your--you stole this land from the Redcheeks, and now the baron has given us leave...leave? Permission?"
1412,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Permission, warrant."
1413,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Whatever. The baron has given us a warrant for your arrest, to take you back to Wolfburg. I know that life’s a blur there. It’s like a hurricane. But let’s--"
1414,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Who knows, you might be arrested, you might solve a mystery. All sorts of things can happen."
1415,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," And change history! Let’s just--let’s--we’ll take you back there, so what do you say? Your time is done. It’s either go back to the goblins with no sheriff to protect, ‘cause look at him. Come on. Look at that pudge. He’s running away. Come with us, and we’ll take you to the baron, and we’ll say that you gave yourself up and throw you on the baron’s mercy, or we can fight you and possibly killify you."
1416,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer, Those are your choices.
1417,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He says,"
1418,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," I always knew you’d betray me, lizard man!"
1419,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales, Racist.
1420,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell, What are you doing waiting? Kill them!
1421,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And now, we’re going to roll initiative, dudes."
1422,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Uh-oh! Battling time! Bumbumbumbum… [continues humming]
1423,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so at this point, guys, when I ask you to roll initiative, roll the 20-sided die and add your initiative bonus."
1424,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I kinda wish I just fired an arrow from the wagon at one of those guys.
1425,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That’s always what you wish, but it’s way cooler to talk shit first."
1426,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I g--yeah.
1427,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Wait, where’s my initiative bonus?"
1428,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Next to your armor class. Should be right there.
1429,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I got 22!
1430,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Nice.
1431,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Wow.
1432,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I got 18.
1433,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Mine’s 11.
1434,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1435,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That’s less than ours.
1436,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And--
1437,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, A lot less.
1438,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And mine...ohhhkay, what’d you roll, uh, Lucien?"
1439,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, 11.
1440,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, 11. Okay. So you guys have the drop on them. They’re still soggy with river water.
1441,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And every time they move, they go squish squish."
1442,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, They’re just trying to wring out their clothes.
1443,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Scales gets to go first.
1444,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh yeah! Uh, now, I wanna s-save--"
1445,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re about 30 feet away from these guys.
1446,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay. What’s the range of my shortbow?
1447,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, w--t--you’re totally within range."
1448,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. I’m gonna fire a shortbow bolt at the sheriff because, frankly, I’m disgusted at how he would l--he would run from his duty and his people."
1449,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He certainly looks like the toughest dude.
1450,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah.
1451,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And he’s also carrying a crossbow.
1452,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, so let’s--I’m gonna fire a shortbow bolt at him."
1453,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, uh--"
1454,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, An arrow.
1455,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re not gonna breathe lightning all over his face?
1456,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, I kinda wanna save that in case I need it. Or maybe I should just use it, I don’t know."
1457,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, That’s your thing!
1458,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Look at--how far away is he?
1459,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, he’s within 30 feet."
1460,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, so that’s lightning range, right?"
1461,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, it’s within lightning range."
1462,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Guys, should I just shoot him with some lightning breath?"
1463,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Shoot some lightning, man."
1464,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Why did we give your guy lightning?
1465,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, that’s a good point."
1466,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," And he’s dripping wet, so he’ll take a penalty due to--"
1467,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, yeah! Okay, gimme some lightning breath on the sheriff, yeah. Forget the shortbow. I forgot for a moment that I was a dragon man."
1468,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s gonna try and dodge out of the way as you--your mouth erupts in crackling lightning.
1469,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [lightning sounds]
1470,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Ohhh, he jumps out of the way at the last minute."
1471,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Noooo!!
1472,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, But he still takes some damage as lightning licks ag--around his feet. So roll a six-sided die.
1473,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1474,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, 2.
1475,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay. So his beard is totes singed.
1476,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Guys, I wasted my lightning breath."
1477,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, do you have a m--do you wanna stay out in the open, or do you "
1478,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,wanna go run and hide behind the cart?,
1479,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uhh… ‘cause I can move, right? Why don’t I take cover behind the cart, ‘cause he’s got a crossbow."
1480,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. So next is, uh, Tanzer Silverview."
1481,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, my--my whip is not in range. My longbow is in range, right?"
1482,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, your longbow’s within range. You can also move up and attack him."
1483,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Um, I--there’s--there’s--the--there’s a sheriff, there’s--"
1484,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Maybe you could wait for them to come to you.
1485,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I can’t believe I wasted my lightning.
1486,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It’ll take an action on their part to come to me, right?"
1487,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, they can move in--you can move and take an action in your turn."
1488,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Um, well, then I--in that case, I will...it l--my rapier’s the strongest weapon, right?"
1489,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep.
1490,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Okay, then I will approach."
1491,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It’s not as sassy as a whip, but it’s more powerful."
1492,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Not as sassy. I’ll save it for Ambrose when we’ve got him down. I will approach and rapier the sheriff.
1493,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay. Yep.
1494,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Roll for…
1495,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you come running on the heels of this lightning attack.
1496,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Heheh, singed--"
1497,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, man, you do an amazing strike, so you run up and stab him right in the chest, and you roll a...this? And add 5 to it."
1498,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1499,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, 9.
1500,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So he takes 9 piercing damage.
1501,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Who is this?
1502,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The sheriff.
1503,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, but I softened him up for you when I singed his beard."
1504,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, there was no more beard to protect him against my sword blade anymore. It was all you."
1505,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah. Yeah, there you go!"
1506,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. So he is bleeding, and he coughs blood into his black, bristly beard."
1507,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Ohh.
1508,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, But there’s not much of it.
1509,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Shot through with dr--
1510,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So singed.
1511,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s totally singed. Lucien.
1512,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," So who do we have left? Is there, like, an angry dwarf or something?"
1513,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," There’s a dwarf that’s currently engaged, who is dropping his crossbow and pulling out his axes to make short work of this one, and you also have a thug who is going to gang up on, uh, on Tanzer Silver… Silverview. And then, uh, Tapwell’s son is loosening his sword from his sword belt."
1514,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I think I’m gonna target--
1515,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, To get vengeance for his brother.
1516,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I’m gonna target the thug since he has taken no damage at this point.
1517,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Mhm.
1518,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Um...and I’m gonna use Poison Spray.
1519,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay?
1520,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Which, uh…"
1521,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, A can of spray that you shake--
1522,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, The creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take 1 die 12 poison damage.
1523,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay. Do you say anything before you poison spray him?
1524,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Uhh…
1525,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Do you go, “Hey, asshole!”?"
1526,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, DXD’s Jason.
1527,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh, yeah, I just say,"
1528,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Suck on this.
1529,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Thug," Suck on wha--aahhh, oh nooo!"
1530,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So he takes how much?
1531,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, 1 die 12 poison damage.
1532,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you roll that 12-sided die…"
1533,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1534,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh, 5."
1535,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. That--that poison splashes in his face, and he goes, “Aaaaaaaahhhh!!” but he doesn’t seem to be quite down, but you have certainly distracted him."
1536,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Total Wayne Knight Jurassic Park moment.
1537,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep. He goes, “Gahh, clever girls!”"
1538,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, that’s not--that was Muldoon’s line."
1539,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, on that note--"
1540,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Don’t even know the character name. That guy.
1541,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Bartok Rocksplitter spits out blood, and he goes,"
1542,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Bartok Rocksplitter," Okay, it’s time for you to die."
1543,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And he rushes you with an axe.
1544,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I stabbed him in the chest!
1545,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, his first axe strike is easily parried with your rapier, but his second one, uh, misses as well, but he is pushing you back up onto the beach. He is no longer standing in the water."
1546,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Hmm. ‘Kay.
1547,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And he’s trying to fight his way toward--
1548,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Wait, he was standing in the water before?"
1549,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep.
1550,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," When I hit him with lightning, did it--the electricity go into the water and hurt anybody else?"
1551,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, they weren’t in the water."
1552,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, man. Okay."
1553,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. Uh, but nice thinking. I like that. Speaking of that, what are you gonna do?"
1554,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It killed a lot of--there’s a lot of fish, like, bubbling--"
1555,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, wait, no, I got two more guys to go."
1556,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," You got two more guys, you got the thug and the Tapwell."
1557,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The thug has got--he’s--wipes the acid off his face, and he starts, uh, moving toward you slowly. And the--his action’s going to be to s--wipe, uh, acid out of his face. And then, uh, but his son, uh…"
1558,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Tapwell, Jr."
1559,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," His son, Augustus Tapwell, junior, goes rushing toward you."
1560,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I’m behind the cart at the moment.
1561,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So he’s gonna go rushing toward the cart? And he, uh, he’s gonna have to dash, then, so he...he is like, "
1562,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus, C-come out of there!
1563,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He’s, like, trying to convince you to come out from around the cart."
1564,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1565,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay! Speaking of which, it’s your turn."
1566,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," So I’m gonna poke my head out from behind the cart, and I’m gonna use Vicious Mockery on him."
1567,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Oh nooo! What?
1568,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," On Augustus Tapwell. Now, this is--I--this is a spell in which I unleash a string of insults--"
1569,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, A spell that you’re very familiar with.
1570,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, --laced with subtle enchantments at a creature within my seeing range. And he must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll by the end of its next turn.
1571,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, he does not resist that very well. He goes,"
1572,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus," Whaa--ghhsgh--I’m sorry, Dad! I’m--doing the best I can! Wwwhhhhhaaaa---"
1573,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, so roll a four-sided die."
1574,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1575,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, 1. I guess that wasn’t so great."
1576,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Only 1, but it’s going to make him less good at beating you up in a second."
1577,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay, that’s great!"
1578,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, and do you stay behind the cart, or do you rush around?"
1579,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, I’ll stay behind there for the moment."
1580,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay. Now we got Tanzer Silverview.
1581,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, So I’m--in front of me is still this--
1582,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re still fighting--
1583,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, --blood-coughing guy swinging a couple of axes.
1584,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you’re fighting the sheriff of the town."
1585,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Right.
1586,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He’s no joke, and you’re a first-level character."
1587,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Right.
1588,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So he’s tough.
1589,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, I...oh, well…"
1590,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Time for you to make a name for yourself, killin’ sheriffs."
1591,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeeeaaah! I’m gonna do that whip--can I--is there, is--at this range, the rapier’s the best bet, right?"
1592,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, yeah."
1593,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Okay, so I--"
1594,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It looks way cooler.
1595,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," It does, it does."
1596,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, But it’s not as sassy as your--
1597,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It’s not as sassy.
1598,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Not as sassy, but I can be sassy with lesser characters. With this character, I take, uh, fighting position stance one."
1599,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1600,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Footwork excellent, and I strike…! 12 plus, uh...5, so that’s 17?"
1601,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You totally hit him again!
1602,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeeeaaah.
1603,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And you do another 8-sided die plus 5, another 9 damage, wow. So you--your, uh--"
1604,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Makin’ short work of this sheriff.
1605,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeeeaaah. Right back in the gut. More blood, I wanna see more blood."
1606,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So your rapier strike, like, goes clean through his left shoulder, and he is--he’s slumped over slightly, and you can see a l--a look in his eyes like maybe he underestimated you."
1607,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tanzer," Yeeeaaahh, I’m a Silverview!"
1608,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I say to him.
1609,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. Now, Lucien, uh, Bottomviewer."
1610,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh, well...first, I’m gonna cast--"
1611,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It’s Buttviewer, my mistake."
1612,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It’s Buttwatcher.
1613,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Buttwatcher.
1614,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Gonna cast Shillelagh.
1615,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay? What do you do--
1616,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, To turn my quarterstaff into a shillelagh.
1617,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Into a magical shillelagh.
1618,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," As Elliott said, take one piece of wood, make it a slightly thicker piece of wood."
1619,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, It also counts as magic!
1620,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Um, and then I’m gonna attack with it."
1621,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay?
1622,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, So...says the weapon’s damage die becomes a die 8.
1623,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep. So it’s gonna make it even better, but before you roll damage, you still gotta hit somebody with it, so…"
1624,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Oh, I’m going after the guy I attacked before."
1625,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, The thug.
1626,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so the thug."
1627,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah.
1628,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, The poison spray guy.
1629,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, The thug who is very angry that he got poison in his face.
1630,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, He’ll be angrier when a shillelagh knocks him in the noggin.
1631,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Roll the 20-sided die, you gotta make an attack roll, and you’re "
1632,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,"gonna add, I think, 4 to it.",
1633,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Ugh.
1634,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Go for the crotch.
1635,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you swing at him…
1636,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, 6.
1637,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, man, that is not a very good roll. Though he is intimidated by this now thicker quarterstaff."
1638,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Did you yell Shillelagh at him?
1639,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I did.
1640,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Shillelagh!
1641,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, now. The sheriff. He’s not likin’ this. He’s still fighting you. He swings. And...oh, he hits you for a total of…"
1642,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Hits who?
1643,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Me.
1644,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Luci--not Lucien, Tanzer."
1645,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Tanzer.
1646,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, remember this is an audio podcast, Stuart."
1647,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Sorry, I’m bad at this part. You take 2 hit points of damage. So you mark those on your sheet."
1648,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," This guy’s bleeding out, and he hits--me--"
1649,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yeah.
1650,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, 2 hit points?
1651,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You’re doing very well.
1652,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, All right.
1653,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, You’re arguing with the very premise of the game right now.
1654,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I guess that’s true. Stands to reason he needs medical attention really quickly.
1655,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The, uh, the--the thug, uh, cautiously, because he doesn’t wanna get acid in his face, uh, takes a swing at you with his mace, uh, Lucien."
1656,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Sure.
1657,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," But he misses. And finally, I got… disadvantage on this… Augustus Tapwell is like,"
1658,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus," Dad, I’m doin’ this for you!"
1659,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And he misses as well. Okay. So, back around. Now you’re, uh, now it’s up to you, uh, it’s up to Scales over here. You’re fighting on the other side of the cart."
1660,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, I’m gonna swing back around to the fight side of the cart.
1661,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you’er gonna try and disengage? Or are you gonna tr--are you gonna--"
1662,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, to--and then I wanna fight, uh, the son."
1663,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1664,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," ‘Cause he’s not--he’s on the other side of the cart, right?"
1665,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He’s on your side now.
1666,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Okay. Oh, he’s on my side now."
1667,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep. He clambered over the ox and started swingin’.
1668,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, then I’ll fight with him."
1669,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1670,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Then I’m gonna--how close is he to me?
1671,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, He is right up on you.
1672,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1673,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, We’ll say melee range.
1674,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, I’m still gonna--I’m gonna use my, my shortbow, though, instead of my dagger, ‘cause it’ll do more damage if I can hit him."
1675,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," But because he’s so close, you have disadvantage on the roll."
1676,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, that’s right. Oh, then I’m--then I’ll use my dagger."
1677,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so make your dagger roll."
1678,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, okay."
1679,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The 20-sided die, and you add whatever the attack bonus is for dagger."
1680,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1681,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So that’s 19!
1682,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Man, that is a huge roll!"
1683,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Plus a 4 attack bonus, so it’s 23."
1684,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, so you totally bl--you totally bury that dagger in his stomach. Roll a, what is it, a d4?"
1685,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, A d4.
1686,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Roll a 4-sided die and add 2.
1687,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, 3."
1688,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Okay.
1689,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, So 1 plus 2 is 3. I gotta roll better.
1690,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Man, you get a lot of 1’s."
1691,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Yeah. I’m very weak.
1692,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He is still fighti--he is fighting with you. He’s a little shocked that he got stabbed. He didn’t think that, uh, you were gonna do that to him."
1693,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Even though he’s been trying to kill me, okay."
1694,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep.
1695,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Is there a concern that we’re--that we’re killing his son? Is that a...should we…
1696,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, He attacked me first!
1697,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I guess that’s true, that’s true, that’s true…"
1698,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, What--why am I concerned that a guy--
1699,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Don’t talk about the morality of adventuring.
1700,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," That’s fair, I’m wondering more for the sake of justice, like, if it’s gonna be a problem if we come back…"
1701,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He has one son still, this guy does!"
1702,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Well, and--"
1703,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Just because you’re a lawyer doesn’t mean that your fantasy creation has to be so concerned with--
1704,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I just want to make sure.
1705,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Look, we’re in the apprehension of a dangerous fugitive who has killed bef--already. Or his family killed, somewhat--we’re in the apprehension of a dangerous fugitive, and his son starts attacking us!"
1706,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Hey, you don’t gotta tell me, I’m murdering the sheriff right now. I’m stabbing the sheriff to death."
1707,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Speaking of which, time for you to stab that sheriff again."
1708,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right, so once again, to deal the fatal death blow…"
1709,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, you’re actually not far from killing this guy. Do you say any last thing to him before you try and deal the final blow?"
1710,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Something about swords.
1711,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, [????]
1712,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," The entire time, I’m shouting, “Silverview!” as I’m stabbing him, so I’m not gonna say anything different. 11 with 5, so 16?"
1713,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," 16, that totally hits him. Roll your damage."
1714,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeeaah. This one?
1715,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yep. Yep, the 8-sided die."
1716,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," 4, 9!"
1717,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So that’s 9 more damage. Your rapier goes right through his throat. He falls to his knees, eyes shocked that his life, the life of Bartok Rocksplitter, a life filled with happiness and violence, has been cut short."
1718,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Do I see that in his eyes?
1719,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You s--you s--
1720,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Do I make a connection with him in the moment of his death?
1721,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, It haunts you forever.
1722,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, And he collapses face-down in--on the gravel shore. Okay.
1723,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," I go through his, uh, effects, trying to find a sick--I find a--"
1724,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We’re in the middle of a fight!
1725,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Lucien.
1726,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [Crosstalk] I just realized I have not employed my character’s flaw this whole time.
1727,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, [Crosstalk] You now have a magical shillelagh.
1728,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah. Now, it says that the...the duration is one minute, but then it also says the spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon."
1729,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You’re not gonna let--you’re probably not gonna let go of the weapon, right?"
1730,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Okay. So it’s still in effect, right?"
1731,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, for a minute. A combat round is, like, 6 seconds."
1732,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Okay.
1733,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So we have 10 of these before we…
1734,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," All right, well, then I, um...first, I attack with the shillelagh again, I guess, with the...I guess."
1735,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Do you should shillelagh when you do it?
1736,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah. I do. Wait. Am I supposed to?
1737,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, “Shillelagh!”
1738,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, A magic character.
1739,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, [deep voice] Shillelagh.
1740,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," I like it, okay. Now you roll the 20-sided die, and you add 4."
1741,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Jesus Christ. Is this a loaded die? I’m getting the worst rolls of anybody.
1742,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Here, I’m gonna give you advantage on that. You can roll a second time."
1743,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That’s a pity advantage.
1744,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, ‘Cause--
1745,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[dice rolling],
1746,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That’s more like it! Your shouting of “shillelagh,” the heavens grant you a boon in the form of advantage. Uh, so you turn--"
1747,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," He rolled a 1, and now rolled a 16."
1748,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He thinks you’re bobbing and weaving, and he bobs at the wrong time, so you are gonna roll the 8-sided die."
1749,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Yeah. [dice rolling] That says 4.
1750,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, and you add 2? So that’s gonna be...one...that’s actually enough. He turns to the side, face still blackened from poison, to have a shillelagh crack against the side of his jaw. Now you have an option, an option I didn’t give--I didn’t give Zhubin. Do you want to kill this, uh, thug? Or do you want to just knock him unconscious."
1751,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh...sure, I feel like I’m a lawful person, so I--"
1752,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You just knock him out?
1753,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I just knock him out.
1754,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Maybe you can convince him to join your team later. He falls down into the dirt.
1755,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, “He threw poison in my face…”
1756,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, “That poison really made me reconsider my life choices.”
1757,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Tapwell’s currently trying to--he’s shaking the reins and trying to urge the oxen up onto the shore so they can--so he can escape, and the cart is slowly moving away."
1758,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, You guys should probably deal with that when it’s your turn to.
1759,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," It’s--and then Tapwell’s son, Augustus Tapwell, potentially the last of his line, depending on what happens to his father--"
1760,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Archie’s still around.
1761,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Poor Archie, in his room right now."
1762,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," After you guys left, the halflings killed Archie."
1763,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Oh no!!
1764,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Noooo!! What happened to justice?
1765,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, They were getting justice for their dead family.
1766,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, poor Archie. We don’t know that they’ve done that. And listen, there’s a big--there’s a big newspaper stand outside the town with a headline that says, “Archie Tapwell Killed By Halflings. City Mourns.” He was the smart Tapwell."
1767,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, man. This Tapwell was also the good fighting Tapwell, and his--"
1768,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Uh-oh.
1769,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," His club comes down in a wicked arc, striking you for 4 hit points of damage."
1770,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oof, that’s a lot."
1771,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, What are you at?
1772,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I mean, I started with 8, so…"
1773,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh, okay."
1774,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Ohhkay, your head is a-ringin’."
1775,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Ayayayayayayayayaya...
1776,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay, guys. You guys have cleared the field. Uhh, what do we do? "
1777,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,"What do we do, Scales?",
1778,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Well, I’m still fighting the--"
1779,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So what are you gonna do?
1780,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I just got hit in the head by, uh, what’s his name, not Archie…"
1781,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," No, this is Augustus."
1782,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Augustus.
1783,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Do you give him another taste of the old dagger?
1784,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," I feel like I’ve gotta, yeah."
1785,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Now that you’ve got a taste for blood, you--"
1786,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And [    ] are ringing in my ears, and that ringing is making it harder for me to think, and so I can’t use--I can’t cast Dissonant Whispers, which would be the other thing I would do, or Tasha’s Hideous Laughter."
1787,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Or Careless Whispers, the most powerful spell."
1788,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, A 3.
1789,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Oh, you totally whiff."
1790,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, boy. ‘Cause I got hit in the head."
1791,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Things are looking grim. Now we have--
1792,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Is this the end of Scales Fangbattle?
1793,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Tanzer. Tanzer, you wanna go for--to try and stop Tapwell from running away, or do you wanna try and help your friend?"
1794,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Uh, I--well, it’s probably better for me to engage in a fight and for Lucien Buttwatcher to run after Tapwell, right? Since I’m pr--I’m a better fighter? So how about I go after--"
1795,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Sure.PA
1796,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," --the son, I’ll go after Augustus."
1797,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, All right.
1798,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, So I...I wonder if I can just sassily hit him from my distance right now.
1799,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, With the whip?
1800,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Yeah, with the whip."
1801,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Go for it.
1802,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Will I be able to reach him?
1803,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Yep.
1804,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," All right. So I’ll, uh, so I’ll go, uh--"
1805,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You plant your rapier in the dirt.
1806,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I take out my whip.
1807,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Unsheath your whip.
1808,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, [humming Indiana Jones theme]
1809,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I hum the Indiana Jones theme.
1810,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, [imitating Indiana Jones?] That’s not a knife!
1811,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Get ready to be sassed!
1812,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, And I--
1813,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Silverview style.
1814,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," What’s your total, what’s your total?"
1815,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Um, and then with 5, it’s, uh...so I got 13?"
1816,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," That’s enough! He’s not very well-armored. Okay, so, but you only roll a 4-sided die."
1817,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Okay.
1818,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," But you add 5. [dice rolling] Man, that is a ton. [pause] Your whip cracks aro--wraps around his neck. You have the option right now. Do you snap that neck and kill him, or do you knock him out?"
1819,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh, I kill him. Oh, I kill him."
1820,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Wow!
1821,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You were so concerned--
1822,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Wait, wait, wait, should we kill him? He’s your son, Tapwell."
1823,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Only you can make this choice. You’ve just tasted first blood, perhaps for the first time. Maybe you’ve got a thirst for the--now you’ve realized how easy it is to kill a man, you wonder why you were taught not to."
1824,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," But I don’t understand why the sheriff’s life wasn’t worth anything if Augustus, uh, Tapwell’s life is worth any--if he was a nobleman, it’d be different, but it turns out they’re nothing but brigands."
1825,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, But you’re angry... [???]
1826,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, I snap that man’s neck.
1827,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," He goes,"
1828,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Augustus, Father!
1829,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And then you hear a, uh, you are standing right next to him when you hear a sickening crunch as his neck is snapped. And his body goes limp."
1830,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, His body.
1831,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, For the last time.
1832,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," His body falls in front of you, leaving your view clear to see me, with the whip, standing there proudly."
1833,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, very heroic. I say,"
1834,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Scales," Thanks, buddy!"
1835,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Lucien. What do you wanna do, man? Do you wanna try and clamber up, do you wanna try and physically stop the oxen?"
1836,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Uh, yeah, I…"
1837,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, That’d be pretty cool.
1838,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, I wanna try and--
1839,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Do you have any spells, you wanna shoot a lightning bolt at ‘em?"
1840,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," You know what, I’ve got Animal Friendship? That means, like, that means I mean them no harm, I can convince animals that I mean them no harm."
1841,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, but it’ll also follow commands."
1842,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," All right, so I’m gonna try and cast Animal Friendship on the oxen."
1843,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You don’t even have to try, you cast it. The, uh, the, it’s a save? Or…"
1844,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Order the oxen to drown.
1845,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Give your life for justice.
1846,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," The oxen do poorly. The oxen looks at you, doe-eyed, awaiting your commands. And Tapwell’s going,"
1847,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Tapwell," No, you stupid animal!"
1848,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," And I yell,"
1849,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Stop!
1850,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," And I say,"
1851,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Lucien, Tapwell. Enjoy making toilet cider. In jail.
1852,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, So you guys quickly subdue Tapwell. He’s a total wimp. What do you guys do with him?
1853,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," We tie him up, right?"
1854,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, We tie him up.
1855,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You tie him up and toss him in the water?
1856,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," No, no, we gotta take him to the baron."
1857,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, We tie him up--
1858,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," We have some bodies to search and look for their stuff, right?"
1859,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Okay. So you find, you’re gonna find a bunch of money, and luckily, the troops quickly rout the goblins who were not expecting to have organized troops to fall upon their rears. So they flee off to the--off, you know, to wherever. And in the end, you guys have won the day."
1860,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,[all cheer],
1861,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,All, Yaaaaaaaayyyy.
1862,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, That’s what Dungeons & Dragons is!
1863,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Uh, so do we--is that it?"
1864,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, That’s the end of the adventure!
1865,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We did it!
1866,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, We bustle our way to the end of the adventure.
1867,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, So we self-bustled our way to--
1868,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah! I mean, does the baron give us anything, or…?"
1869,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Uh, yeah, the baron, uh, no, he doesn’t give you anything. You guys got plenty of money!"
1870,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, Okay.
1871,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Do the--
1872,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, I’m assuming you’re going to loot Tapwell’s stuff to get the rest of the money he owes you.
1873,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh, for sure."
1874,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, and Jeremy sleeps with that lady, I assume."
1875,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, Yeah.
1876,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," You settle down, get married. Yeah, it’s the last adventure you guys ever have."
1877,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Looks like that’s the end of the fearsome threesome. It’s just me and you now, Buttwatcher, now that Luci--"
1878,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, You don’t go back to the Redcheek farm and marry the halfling girl?
1879,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Oh yeah, perhaps--you know what? I feel like--"
1880,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin, You have to make an honest woman out of her after she gave you a handjob.
1881,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," She just looks at me, and she says, “My hand is pregnant!” and I say, “Okay, all right, we’ll get married.”"
1882,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," And I roam the world alone, being like, “Well, that was a waste of time.” My vision said that these people would help me find what I was looking for, but apparently not."
1883,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Settling down and having a family sometimes can be the greatest mystery of the universe.
1884,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, it seems like, Dan, your character has missed the most important knowledge."
1885,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What’s that?
1886,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," I mean, I--"
1887,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, What’s in the hole?
1888,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan," Yeah, mostly, like, holes in the ground."
1889,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," So… okay, guys, well, thanks for playing Dungeons & Dragons with me, and thanks for, you guys, for listening to it, and--"
1890,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Dan, Thanks for donating.
1891,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," And definitely thanks for donating, and, uh, I guess--"
1892,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Thanks to the Adventure Zone boys for, uh, lettin’ us take their stuff a little bit."
1893,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Yeah, giving us a sandbox to play in. And thanks for playing, Zhubin!"
1894,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Oh, thanks for having me."
1895,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And Stuart, thanks for running a great adventure."
1896,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Zhubin," Thanks, Stuart!"
1897,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," And Stuart, thanks for taking us to Great Adventure after the recording."
1898,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart," Wait, what?"
1899,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott," Yeah, you paid for our tickets, our rides, everything."
1900,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, But my flash pass only works for one person.
1901,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Elliott, We’ll just all dress like you.
1902,The Adventure Zone Presents: The Great Switcheroo,Stuart, Come back next time.
